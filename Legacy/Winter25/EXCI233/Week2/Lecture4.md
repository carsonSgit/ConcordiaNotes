# Lecture 4: Mental Health


### Mental Disorders

Prevalence of mental health complications has increased in recent years (awareness, etc.)

More than 1 in 3 people with mood/anxiety/substance disorders do not receive sufficient aid.

Women have higher diagnosis rate than men (patriarchal shame, bias, etc.)

**Hippocampus** stores and processes information. Helps control/dial down the stress response. A strong hippocampus causes greater control over your stress response.

**Unstressed/Calm state** easier processing of everything, tight control of thoughts, emotions, and actions.

**Stressed state** communication between prefrontal cortex and amygdala breaks down, amygdala grows & prefrontal cortex can shrink in nerve cell connections. Weaker control of thoughts, emotions, and actions.

How does the brain change in response to chronic stress?: permanent damage

Stress can affect brain: size, structure, function

Which stress hormone negatively impacts brain function: Cortisol

Chronic stress can impair: neural connections in amygdala, HPA Axis (effects stress control)

Changes in brain structure include: size, brain cell production, brain DNA
