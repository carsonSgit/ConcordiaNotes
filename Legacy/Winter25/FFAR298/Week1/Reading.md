# Jill Bennett -- "Living in the Anthropocene"

We are living in a proposed new geologic era, said to have begun in 1784 with the invention of the steam engine.

The environment since has changed rapidly in comparison to other geologic eras, like the Holocene which lasted *only* 10-12 thousand years, versus the Pleistocene which had lasted 1.8 million years.

This new era is one of great environmental damage and decay, with excess methane and carbon dioxide filling the atmosphere.

The Anthropocene is uprooting and causing a paradigm shift, changing how we view the world itself.
This paradigm shift is rejected by those who do not believe in climate change and the damage caused by it.

The struggle for advancement within this new paradigm is to get everyone in agreement about what needs to be done to help improve the state of the world.

How will you have to change to live in the Anthropocene?

Art is now a reflection on the current earth system; land, ocean, atmosphere.

Ecological thought about what we have to do to operate properly and effictively is what it means to live in the Anthropocene.
