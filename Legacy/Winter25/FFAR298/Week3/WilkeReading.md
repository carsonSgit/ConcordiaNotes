# Anthropocenic Poetics: Ethics and Aesthetics in a New Geological Age

"Kant's emphasis on the role of human subjectivity had an enormous infuence
on how the relation between humans and the non-human world was perceived and
consequently constructed in terms of privileging human existence over the existence of
non-humans." -> Kant put forth the idea of which society constructed it's beliefs, an idea that put forth the ideal of Anthropocentrism, the belief that humans are at the center, the primary "being".


"not only do humans shape the world of the objects, but that all relations between humans and non-humans alter the parties involved." 

"In the Anthropocene, where the interconnectivity of every part
with everything else is an important feature of all world relations and the world of the
human and the non-human is profoundly intertwined, a perspective that emphasizes
objects, and especially one that foregrounds the idea of an equal footing among object
relations, is helpful in order to conceptualize the relationship between humans and
their non-human environments."

Kant & Carl Gustav Carus' ideas can be demonstrated through creation of art and works through creation of something from what already exists, i.e. sculpting soil, chiseling rocks, etc. -> Exploring our embodiment in the environment in the Anthropocene.

"In the Anthropocene, we revisit and challenge the limitations of Kantian dualism and reconceive of non-human reality not as something subordinate to human perception, but
as related to human reality and interacting with it on equal terms"


"A new critical philosophy in the Anthropocene not only needs to be paired with a postcolonial perspective but also complemented with an environmental justice framework that emphasizes the active role of nature and the environment. In current discussions of the Anthropocene, none of these aspects have been developed in any systematic fashion"
