# Happiness: The Foundations

### Discussion

More so a focus on internal,

Sadness is the primary state -> the absence of sadness is happyness

A spectrum lens -> perspective and scope

Happiness is the culmination of desires (reward-based) vs. happiness is the lack of desire (general contentness)

### Key question

- What exactly is happiness?
- What constitutes happiness?

**Three Accounts of what happiness is:**

- Hedonism
- Life Satisfaction
- Emotional State

---

**Starting assumption:**

There is a truth of the matter of what happiness is, objectively correct account of happiness and we will be trying to figure out what that account is.

**Clarification:**

Different things can cause different people to have or be in the state that objectively constitutes happiness
    - i.e. coding is pleasurable for me, watching sports may be pleasurable for you

----

**Descriptive vs. Normative:**

Descriptive claims: claims about how things are
    - ex. Around 1.7 million people live in MOntreal
    - ex. Justin Trudeau has a degree from McGill
Normative claims: claims about how things ought to be or htat involve evaluative judgement
    - ex. Montreal is a great city to live in
    - ex. Justin Trudeau is brilliant

Accounts about the nature of happiness are making descriptive claims about what hpapiness is, not normative claims

---

**Criteria for a plausible account:**

What makes an account of happiness plausible

- The Descriptive Adequacy Criterion
- The Partical Utility Criterion


**Descriptive Adequacy:**

An account of X is descriptively adequate if and only if it is compatible with and makes sense of what we already know about X.

An account of happiness is descriptively adequate if and only if it is compatbiel with and makes sense of our strong steady widely shared instituions about happiness

- Intuitions are how things seem to us, what strikes us as true
- Intuitions about happiness arise from our rough, inarticulate sense of what happiness is that we have by virtue of our everyday familiarity with happiness

**Practical Import:**

We treat/view happiness as something very important -> general given a lot of practical weight in our deliberations, evaluations, predictions, and explanations.

Plausible account of happiness needs to make sense of such (even if it tells us that happiness is not all that important).

--- 

**Summing everything up:**

- We assume that there is an *objective truth* about what happiness is
- Account of nature of happiness make *descriptive claims*, not normative ones
- Plausible account of happiness should be *descriptively adequate (criterion 1)* and make sense of the *practical import of happiness (criterion 2)*

### Discussion

Intuitions about happiness -> a state that can't be permanent (relies on contrasting emotions), small things can make a difference, happiness is a general desire

Hard to weigh about what is the definite view of *what is happiness*
