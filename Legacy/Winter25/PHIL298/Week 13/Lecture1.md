# Government Paternalism

### Terminology

**Paternalistic government interference:**

When a government interferes with S's self-regarding choices, against S's will, by using (threats of) punishment to promote S's own wellbeing - e.g., seatbelt mandates

**Self-Regarding choice:**

A choice that S's makes that mainly affects S herself.

**Non-paternalistic government interference:**

When a government interferes in S's choices, against S's will, by using (threats of) punishment to prevent S from harming others - e.g., laws against drunk driving.

### The Argument Against Seatbelt Mandates

(1) If a person's self-regarding choice is not harmful to others, then public officials should not paternalistically use (threats of) punishment to prevent that person from making that choice.

(2) Riding unbelted is a self-regarding choice that is not harmful to others.

(3) Therefore, 

### Defending Premise 1

**The AUtonomy Argument:**

Paternalistic policies disrespect citizens' autonomy.

**The Body Argument:**

Paternalistic policies infringe on people's right to choose what happens to their own bodies.

**The Bad Consequences Argument:**

It's plausbile that bad consequences of adopting/enforcing some paternalistic policies outweigh their good consequences.

**The Disproportionate Burden Argument:**

Adopting/enforcing paternalistic policies disproportionately burdens marginalized groups.

**The Offensive Attitudes Argument:**

Paternalistic policies express offenseive attitudes towards citizens.

### The Trivial Condition

Even if there is a strong general case against paternalistic policies, there might be some exceptions.

**The Trivial Condition:**

If reasons in favour of allowing a risky choice are relatively trivial and the benefits of paternalism are substantial, then it is permissible to adopt paternalistic policies that prohibit that choice.

**Flanigan's Response:**

- The choice to ride unbelted itself is not trivial for those who strongly prefer comfort and convenience over safety.
- The freedom to ride unbelted without punishment is not trivial when the alternative is being subjected to a costly mandate.

### The Capacities Condition

**The Capacities Condition:**

If a risky choice would significantly damage a person's rational cpacities and prohibition would effectively protect these capacities, then it is permissible to adopt paternalistic policies that prohibit that choice.

**Flanigan's Response:**

The choice to ride unbelted merely RISKS damaging/destroying a person's rational capacities, and paternalistic policies that protect against mere risk are not justified.
- Consider: Prohibitions against fast food, a sedentary lifestyle.
