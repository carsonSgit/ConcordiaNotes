# Wellbeing part 2: Hedonism & Subjectivist Theories

**Wellbeing:**

Concerns how well your life is going *for you*

**Two aspects of wellbeing:**

Subject Relativity & Normative Significance

**Objectivist Theories:**

Whether something is good for you does **NOT** depend on your attitude towrads that thing

### Hedonism about Wellbeing

**Hedonism:**

What is good for you is pleasure and an absence of pain.

- A type of objective theory
- Different from hedonism about happiness

**The Appeal:**

Can easily explain the normative significance aspect of wellbeing -- pleasure is clearly good for the one experiencing pleasure

### Subjective Theories About Wellbeing

**Subjective Theories:**

Whether a thing is good for you *depends solely* on your attitude towards it

**Types of Subjective Theories:**

*Actual Desire* Theory: Your life is going well for you to the extent that your actual desires are satisfied

- Problem: We often desire things that are bad for us because we are mis- or under- informed

*Informed Desire* Theory: Your life is going well for you to the extent that your hypothetical informed desires are satisfied

**The Appeal:**

Accomodates the subject-relativity aspect of wellbeing

### The Normative Problem

These are some (infomred) desires whose satisfaction would not be good for the desirer, or even good at all

- *Harmful* desires whose satisfaction harm the desirer (drug addicts)
- *Trivial* desires for trifling or pointless things
- *Remote* desires for things very far removed from the desirer
- *Adaptive* desires based on values and views formed in circumstances of oppression
