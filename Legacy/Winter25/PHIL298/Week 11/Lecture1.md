### Oppressive & Ambiguous Pleasures

**Oppressive Pleasures:**

- Pleasure derived from activities that undermine your own self-interest
- Hedonism problematically entails that oppressive pleasures contribute to wellbeing

**Ambiguous Pleasures:**

- Multifaceted experiences involving pleasure + pain
- Hedonism boils down experiences to pleasurable or not and so cannot capture the complxity of ambiguous pleasures

### Feminism & Desire Satisfaction

**Desire Satisfaction Theory (DTS):**

Your life is going well for you to the extent that your desires are satisfied

**The Appeal for Feminism:**

Captures some of the ways that gender inequality undermines women's wellbeing since many relevant harms involve frustration of women's desires - e.g., a desire for equal pay

**The Problem of Deformed/Adaptive Desires:**

Desires formed under oppressive circumstances whose satisfaction seems bad for the desirer

### Feminism & Informed Desire Satisfaction

**Informed Desire Satisfaction Theory (IDTS):**

Your life is going well for you to the extent that your hypothetical informed desires are satisfied.

**Two Worries:**

Women might not desire the things that seem good for them if they were fully informed.

Even if they did, the satisfaction of hypothetical informed desires seems too distant from the actual women to affect their wellbeing.

### Feminism & Objective Theories

**Objective Theories:**

Your life is going well for you to the extent that you have certain objectively valuable goods (or the capability to function along certain dimensions).

**The Appeal for Feminism:**

- Captures harms that are pleasurable / not painful
- Captures harms that do not frustrate desires
- Can explain how gender injustice detracts from the wellbeing of men
