# Animal Wellbeing

### Key Questions

- What makes it the case that an animal's life goes well for it?
- What is in that animal's best interests? 
- What benefits the animal?

### Hedonism about Animal Wellbeing

**Hedonism:**

An animal's life is going well for it to the extent that its pleasurable experiences outweigh its painful experiences.

**The Appeal:**

Concern for animal wellbeing is often motivated by the fact that animals are sentient

### Groer & The Experience Machine

Grover is a golden retirever. His loving owner/dad Bob is considering whether to plug Grover up to the experinece machine. Bob wants whatever's best for Grover. If Grover is plugged up to the experience machine, he will enjoy an endless series of his favourite experiences: eating treats, getting belly rubs from Bob, frolicking in meadows, and splashing in mud puddles.

Would Grover be better off plugged into the experience machine?

- "Yes" - there's good reason to accept hedonism about animal wellbeing
- "No" - there's good reason to reject hedonism about animal wellbeing

### Animals & Desire Satisfaction

**Desire Satisfaction Theory (DST):**

An animal's life is going well for it to the extent that its desires are being satisfied.

- Most cognitively simple animals desire only pleasure

**The Problem of Bad Desires:**

Implies that desires whose satisfaction would be bad for the desirer contribute to the desirer's wellbeing - e.g., Grover's desire for chocolate

### Animals & Informed Desires

**Informed Desire Satisfaction Theory (IDST):**

An animal's life is going well for it to the extent that the desires it would have if it were fully informed are being satisfied.

**The Problem:**

Most animals don't have the cognitive capacities to be fully informed.

**An Alternative Solution:**

If the satisfaction of an animal's bad desire frustrates other future desires, the satisfaction of that desire is bad (overall) for the animal.

### Animals & Objective Theories

An animal's life is going well for it to the extent that it is *flourishing* as a member of its species, independenlty of whether the animal enjoys or wnats the relevant aspects of flourishing - e.g., Nussbaum's Capabilities Theory
