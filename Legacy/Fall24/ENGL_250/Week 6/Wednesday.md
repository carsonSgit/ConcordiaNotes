**The Horror Novel**

- Supernatural elements vary across greater extremes
- Horror still deals with the Body and the Gaze
  - Romance/erotica explores the joy of having and being in a body
  - Crime is about controlling or violating the body
  - Horror is about the abjection of the Body

**Abjection** KEYWORD

- From Julia Kristeva's *Powers of Horror* (1980)
- The abject is the intermediary between subject and object
- The subject is the thinking, agential, psychological being
  - In grammar, the subject is the thing that acts
- Object is the inert, mechanical, non-being
  - In grammar, the object is the thing that is acted on 
- Abjection is **waste**
  - It inspires disgust
- Subjectivity is tied to the body
  - The sense of abjection is the same feeling toward bodily waste
- Abjection is not totally alien, but it is relatable in ways that are shameful or gross
- The abject is also unknowable
  - What if all we are is the waste we leave behind?
- The criminal and the monster are irrational

**Abjection and the Body Politics**

- "Just imagine that imaginary machine transformed into a social insititution--and what you get is the infamy of facism" - Kristeva, 25

**The Abject in fiction**

- Edgar Allan Poe
  - "The Cask of Amontillado"
  - Abject is the unknown motive; the indifference to justice
    - Points to the frailty of law and social action
- H.P. Lovecraft
  - Afraid of the unknown
    - Fear that the knowledge of the west is at risk of decay in regards to non-Western knowledge

**Sublimation** KEYWORD

- The Sublime is something of indescribable beauty
  - Aesthetic, mathematical, spiritual
- Sublimation is the process of turning something unacceptable into something acceptable
  - Fear of death into enjoyment of fear
  - Disgust of Otherness into a monster

**Horror and Empathy**

- Sublimation as a mode of developing empathy
  - We are all always in the process of decay from the moment we are born
  - That is grounds for solidarity and compassion
- Or it's a way to treat Otherness as something to try to flee from
- Horror is a way of achieving catharsis
  - We are all going to die, everything is temporary
