"There’s more to life than the monomyth: multiperspectival approaches to teaching narrative and story in university film and media departments" - Julie Aston

#### The Abstract

The abstract explains that the article will be talking about the issue of Hollywood's domination on the film industry which directly effects the practice of film globally.

#### Article

*Paraphrased*: Society is dominated by a screen-centered consumption of media, it is the new form of content that is most prevalent in the lives of Gen-Z. - British Film Institute, 2022 (Screen Culture/2033 ten-year plan).

Essentially, the plan states the importance of inclusion of the human experience (no race, gender, sexuality, cultural (etc.) "differences"). I.E. to connect through stories, we need equality.

"I question the idea that conflict is the engine of all good stories. I argue that harmony is also important and that we should be exploring the dynamic between the two, inorder to develop approaches that are ﬁt for purpose in a changing and uncertain world." - Julie Aston (Media practice and Education, Page 2).

##### Framing the issues

What should we be encouraging students to write (film, stories) -> Teach to innovate or to use what is known to "work". Through innovation, what else needs to change? What business models would need to be put in to place to validate these new approaches?

##### Defining narrative and story

Story: Everything to be shown, all the elements given.
Narrative: The way the elements are depicted, the act of showing the story.

##### Moving beyond the monomyth

Monomyth/Hero's journey: The idea that a story must be told around one point of view. Surrounding a story around an isolated view from one character, making that view the dominant one demonstrated through the narrative.

Issue at hand -> Film students are taught under the view of that monomyth.

Jeff Gomez introduces the idea of a "Collective Journey" rather than the "Hero's Journey".

Gomez's idea strives for the creation of a story where the audience has a say in the narrative of a story.

--> The collective journey storytelling ideology is a biproduct of the progressive agenda in which we learn to move past individualism.

Donna Haraway's idea of a replacement to the monomyth is one that defocuses from mankind and the anthropocentrism that is at the core of the monomyth. Instead stories should be told under the guise of life, i.e. multispecies.

###### The contemporary commissioning landscape & Teaching Students

The Hero's Journey is a dominant story structure that forces artists to make works that they are not passionate about in order to make a living as the commisions/contracts are done in order to make money, and to stray from the known monomyth is to risk capital investments.

###### Conclusion

To promote a positive future of expression, we must encourage and explore different ways of storytelling and narrative-delivery.
