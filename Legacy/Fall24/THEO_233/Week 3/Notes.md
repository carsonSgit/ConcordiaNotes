### Science, communism and religion

- Debates between the growth of secularization and the strength of religion.
    - Secularization was strongly pushed globally and was repeatedly thought to soon go into full effect, essentially wiping out religion
- Religion is coming back into the public sphere
    - Evangelicals across the world
    - Prevalent figures like Donald Trump (Ex-President, current Presidential candidate) pushing the importance of influence of religion in the public sector

- Models of the interaction between science and religion
    - Non-confrontaitional models
        - Science and religion are convergent
        - Science and religion are distinct
    - Confrontational models
        - Warfare Image: There is war between science and Christianity
        - The Draper-White view: Christianity has waged war on science
        - Religious Fundamentalist view: Science waged war on Christianity

- Non-confrontational models
    - Science and relgion are convergent
    - All advances in scientific understanding of the universe are to be welcomed and accommodated within the Christian faith
    - Requires adjustment of the faith -> Liberal Protestantism
    - Albrecht Ritschl and other liberal Protestants argued that evolutionary theories allowed theology to appreciate the manner which God was present and active in the world
    - Process theology has sought to adapt Christian tradition to the insights of natural sciences 

- Non-confrontational models
    - Science and religion are distinct
    - Neo-orthodoxy: Movement regarded as a reaction to liberal Protestantism, especially its accommodationist tendencies
    - Karl Barth: Natural Sciences have no bearing on Christian Theology
    - Natural sciences have no connection to faith, they operate on the basis of very different assumptions
    - Langdon Gilkey: Natural Sciences concerned with "how" (interactions with nature), Theology is concerned with "why" (ultimate origin and purpose of nature)

- Confrontational models
    - Draper-White view
    - Sociologically, the war/competition between two groups in Victorian England: Priests and Scientific professionals. The latter tried to displace the former.
    - Flaws of the Draper-White view:
        - In antiquity, there was nothing corresponding to modern science as a whole. Theologians and Philosophers did not oppose each other (as they were religious).
        - Pagan philosophy seen as tolerant while Christianity is intolerant. In reality, pagans were not scholars like the ones today but they shared religious beliefs and at times were very intolerant
        - Some modern supporters of the warfare image: some scientists

- Confrontational models
    - Religious Fundamentalist view: Science waged war on Christianity
    - Henry Morris, President of the Institute for Creation Science, The Long War against God: Critique of modern evolutionary theory
        - Morris believes that Satan planted the idea of evolution as a means of dethroning God

- Religion under Communism

        - Believes that religion was invented by Priests to control the people
    - Communism in the Soviet Union (1918-1991) and Eastern Europe (1945-1989)
    - 150 years after Marx's remark, it turned out that communism disappeared
    - Religion was reborn like a mythological Phoenix bird in both Eastern Europe and in China

- Religion in Eastern Europe
    - East side of Eastern Europe: Primarily Catholic
    - Center of Eastern Europe: Primarily Orthodox
    - Bottom/Right of Easter Europe: Primarily Muslim
- The borders between Relgions (i.e. Border between Catholic & Orthodox) are seen as possible conflict hubs
    - Not true, take look at Russia Vs. Ukraine, both countries are Orthodox
- Proper Democracy is possible regardless of prevalent Religion within a Country
    - Religion is not all too prevalent and obsessive within state relations

- Predominantly Orthodox Russia, Ukraine, Romainia, and Bulgaria
    - Communist parties started by eliminating foreign influence of churches that could not be controlled
        - Catholic 
        - Protestant
        - As their leadership resided outside of the Orthodox countries
    - Roman Catholics
        - Activities severely curtailed

- Predominantly Catholic Countries
    - Collaboration of churches was sought
    - Dividing leadership, anti-religious subjects taught in schools, censoring religious publications
    - Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland became Pope John Paul II in 1978 (citizen of Communist Poland)
        - Political impact of this election was enormous and the Soviets realized this
    - Pope John Paul II supported the Solidarity Workers Union in its reovolt against communism
    - June 1989, communists ost the elections in Poland, end of Communism in Poland
    - Berlin Wall collapsed a few months later, by the end of 1989 most Eastern European countries got rid of communism

- Religion has a strong cultural element
    - People don't necessarily attend church but they may identify as christian (etc.)
    - In England, some schools are sought after by parents for their Religious influence, so while families don't practice and attend church, the schools are very coveted to house children for the education quality & religious influence
