# Miscellaneous B.S. i think of during class

- need to pay tuition ASAP :(
- haircut
    - hella layers
    - keep long
    - staircase-ish cut for hair front-of-face
        - i.e. hair in front is longest at sides of face, gradually shortening as you go up the face
            - stops at middle/bottom of eye
    - trim back, keep long
        - would like to see a *bit* of my neck, but i dont want it cut close to skin
        - ideally a gajillion layers
    - bring sides in
