<h2>Date: September 19, 2024</h2>
<h3>Science, communism and religion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Debates between the growth of secularization and the strength of religion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secularization was strongly pushed globally and was repeatedly thought to soon go into full effect, essentially wiping out religion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is coming back into the public sphere</p>
<ul>
<li>Evangelicals across the world</li>
<li>Prevalent figures like Donald Trump (Ex-President, current Presidential candidate) pushing the importance of influence of religion in the public sector</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Models of the interaction between science and religion</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-confrontaitional models
<ul>
<li>Science and religion are convergent</li>
<li>Science and religion are distinct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confrontational models
<ul>
<li>Warfare Image: There is war between science and Christianity</li>
<li>The Draper-White view: Christianity has waged war on science</li>
<li>Religious Fundamentalist view: Science waged war on Christianity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-confrontational models</p>
<ul>
<li>Science and relgion are convergent</li>
<li>All advances in scientific understanding of the universe are to be welcomed and accommodated within the Christian faith</li>
<li>Requires adjustment of the faith -> Liberal Protestantism</li>
<li>Albrecht Ritschl and other liberal Protestants argued that evolutionary theories allowed theology to appreciate the manner which God was present and active in the world</li>
<li>Process theology has sought to adapt Christian tradition to the insights of natural sciences</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-confrontational models</p>
<ul>
<li>Science and religion are distinct</li>
<li>Neo-orthodoxy: Movement regarded as a reaction to liberal Protestantism, especially its accommodationist tendencies</li>
<li>Karl Barth: Natural Sciences have no bearing on Christian Theology</li>
<li>Natural sciences have no connection to faith, they operate on the basis of very different assumptions</li>
<li>Langdon Gilkey: Natural Sciences concerned with "how" (interactions with nature), Theology is concerned with "why" (ultimate origin and purpose of nature)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confrontational models</p>
<ul>
<li>Draper-White view</li>
<li>Sociologically, the war/competition between two groups in Victorian England: Priests and Scientific professionals. The latter tried to displace the former.</li>
<li>Flaws of the Draper-White view:
<ul>
<li>In antiquity, there was nothing corresponding to modern science as a whole. Theologians and Philosophers did not oppose each other (as they were religious).</li>
<li>Pagan philosophy seen as tolerant while Christianity is intolerant. In reality, pagans were not scholars like the ones today but they shared religious beliefs and at times were very intolerant</li>
<li>Some modern supporters of the warfare image: some scientists</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confrontational models</p>
<ul>
<li>Religious Fundamentalist view: Science waged war on Christianity</li>
<li>Henry Morris, President of the Institute for Creation Science, The Long War against God: Critique of modern evolutionary theory
<ul>
<li>Morris believes that Satan planted the idea of evolution as a means of dethroning God</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion under Communism</p>
<ul>
<li>Karl Marx: Religion "the opium of the people" was to disappear as socialism gave way to communism
<ul>
<li>Believes that religion was invented by Priests to control the people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communism in the Soviet Union (1918-1991) and Eastern Europe (1945-1989)</li>
<li>150 years after Marx's remark, it turned out that communism disappeared</li>
<li>Religion was reborn like a mythological Phoenix bird in both Eastern Europe and in China</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion in Eastern Europe</p>
<ul>
<li>East side of Eastern Europe: Primarily Catholic</li>
<li>Center of Eastern Europe: Primarily Orthodox</li>
<li>Bottom/Right of Easter Europe: Primarily Muslim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The borders between Relgions (i.e. Border between Catholic &#x26; Orthodox) are seen as possible conflict hubs</p>
<ul>
<li>Not true, take look at Russia Vs. Ukraine, both countries are Orthodox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper Democracy is possible regardless of prevalent Religion within a Country</p>
<ul>
<li>Religion is not all too prevalent and obsessive within state relations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predominantly Orthodox Russia, Ukraine, Romainia, and Bulgaria</p>
<ul>
