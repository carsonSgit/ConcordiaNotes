</li>
<li>Crime fiction is iextricable from the:

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Globalization</strong> KEYWORD</p>

<li>Sometimes pro-xenophobia</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Not about what is fair: this causes anxiety</li>
<li>Crime fiction wrestles with this anxiety</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crime fiction is Urban</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People are transformed from "individuals" to "populations"</li>
<li>Urbanity offers opportunity to encounter the strange and unknown
<ul>
<li>Also a way for people to be made to disappear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cities are always dependent on people and actions outside of them</li>
<li>Cities are seen as an opportunity for growth and also a place full of filth -- prevalent in crime stories as well</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flaneur</strong> KEYWORD</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Perpetual pedestrian</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free to obeserve while being unobserved
<ul>
<li>Graeme Gilloch - <em>Noir sans frontiers</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The detective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Could be 1 person or an ensemble</li>
<li>Almost never a member of the regular police
<ul>
<li>Also often not even an official detective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always an outsider</li>
<li>State relies on them/tolerates them, but there is no direct control</li>
<li>Thanks to their outsider position, they are often seen as a witness, ignorable
<ul>
<li>Allows them to pass through anywhere (access to everywhere) but they may not belong anywhere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Detective is the master of secrets</li>
<li>Crime is often shown as a form of deviance</li>
<li>The focus, focalizer, and the embodiment of what Crime fiction explores</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hard-Boiled Detective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marks the shift to <em>Noir</em></li>
<li>The detective as everyman
<ul>
<li>Usually some guy beaten down by everyday life</li>
<li>Contravenes the Platonic Ideal of detectives like Holmes or Poirot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not just flawed; often unforgiveable or criminals themselves
<ul>
<li>Emotionally stunted by the machinations around them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crime around the Globe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hardboiled detectives are often as much criminals as their antagonists</li>
<li>Noir fuels the already global momentum of crime fiction throughout the 20th century</li>
