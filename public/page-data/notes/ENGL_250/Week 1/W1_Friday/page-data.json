This is the purpose of art\"\r\n-</p>\n<p><strong>Oscare Wilde</strong>\r\n- Irish playwright/poet\r\n- \"All art is quite useless\" - <em>The picture of Dorian Gray</em>\r\n- \"A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that is to be said about our relation to flowers. Of course man may sell the flower, making it useful to him, but this is not of the nature of the flower, it has nothing to do with it's purpose.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Art as Emotion</strong>\r\n- Plato says art == poor imitation of the Ideal\r\n- Sydney says art advances and expands the Ideal\r\n- Tolstoy + Wilde == art is expression of emotion\r\n- Tolstoy sees this as sacred\r\n- Wilde treats it as joy that cannot be captured by ulterior motives</p>\n<p><strong>Focus of this course</strong>\r\n- Examine what texts are doing.\r\n- Interested in the effect of the text -- not the purpose but end result.\r\n- Genre lacks cultural capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Capital</strong> KEYWORD\r\n- Resource that can be acrued, invested, paid off as a form of capital through associations with institutes\r\n- Method of embuing an institue with a form of power (employment, financial, etc.)\r\n- Literature holds high cultural capital -- helps people measure objects/things associated with the texts\r\n- Genre/fiction has a lower tier, \"cheaper\" kind of cultural capital than literature\r\n- Literature will be approached as political containers of active ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>ASSEMBLAGE</strong> KEYWORD\r\n- Idea that being and agency emerges from dispersed interactions\r\n- Not innate qualities\r\n- Not learned\r\n- More than the sum of all parts involved\r\n- EVERYTHING the object comes into contact with (history, creators, associations, emotion, etc.) becomes a part of the text\r\n- When reading, you bring in yourself to the reading. All of your emotions, thoughts, feelings, personality, etc. gets added <em>to</em> that text.\r\n- Think \"entanglement\"\r\n- Nothing at the <em>core</em> of the <em>thing</em>, just expanded <em>layers</em>.\r\n- An interaction, kept alive as long as it is being read.</p>\n<p><strong>The Novel</strong>\r\n- Focus of course\r\n- Prose longform fiction\r\n- Was a genre, form of \"low art\"\r\n- Has been around long enough to acquire enough <strong>cultural capital</strong> to be considered literature\r\n- Means \"new\"\r\n- Origins are contested\r\n- Popularized as ability to read became more accessible\r\n- When a culture wants to reject literature as non-serious -- depicted as a \"feminine art\"</p>\n<p><strong>EPISTEMOLOGY</strong> KEYWORD\r\n- Knowledge about knowing\r\n- Theory about where knowledge comes from, how it is curated\r\n- What knowledge is <em>allowed</em> to exist -- what is acceptable\r\n- i.e. what is socially permissable\r\n- Related to Ontology - study of being/existing\r\n- What we are is what we know\r\n- Literature is a practice of epistemology</p>\n<p><strong>MONOMYTH</strong> KEYWORD\r\n- i.e. the \"Hero's Journey\"\r\n- Master category for all stories\r\n- Belief that all stories must share a common structure\r\n- Functionally constrains the idea of creativity and variety in literature\r\n- Based on <strong>Joseph Campbell's</strong> <em>Hero with a Thousand Faces</em> book written in 1949</p>\n<p><strong>Genre and the Monomyth</strong>\r\n- To maintain the monomyth, difference is ignored or changed to fit the structure\r\n- Genres are porous and mix with one another\r\n- Genre is a chance to break free from the conventions of a monomyth\r\n- Genre is it's own rigid set of conventions\r\n- Genre means \"type\", it must be recognizable as the \"type\" it falls under\r\n- Therefore it must always fit this category, essentially becoming a miniature monomyth\r\n- How does genre allow us to expand our understanding of literature and social politics?\r\n- How does genre free us, yet constrain us to a form of existence?\r\n- Idealization of the monomyth has a creative violence against other stories, an ostracization of other forms of stories (Indigenous literature, etc.)\r\n- If you do not fit the monomyth (the story of \"One man\") then you do not belong to the society, as the monomyth is the encapsulisation of \"man\"</p>\n<h2>KEYWORDS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural Captial</li>\n<li>Assemblage</li>\n<li>Epistemology</li>\n<li>Monomyth</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Homework</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get books</li>\n<li>Choose a group\n<ul>\n<li>Come up with questions for sci-fi, be a good spectator</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do forum post</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7e1d5d6f-bc36-54ab-bfb2-6ceedb3f8cce"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
