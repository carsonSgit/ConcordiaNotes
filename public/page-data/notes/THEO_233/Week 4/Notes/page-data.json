They ignore the impact of religion, despite the fact that world shaking political movements have so often been fueled by religious fervor\" - <strong>Robert Keohane</strong></p>\n<h4>Separation of religion from politics</h4>\n<p>Some critics of the idea presented above say that the separation of religion and politics (secularism) should not be globalized.</p>\n<p>Secularity is defined negatively as what is left after religion fades -- it is not neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>United States of America Supreme Court</strong> took the First Ammendment and applied it in a particular way -- favoured non-religion. This has since changed though since mid 90s/early 2000s.</p>\n<h4>Distinction of religion from politics</h4>\n<p>Secular<em>ism</em> is the ideology promoting secularity.</p>\n<p>Secularism is the ruling of society under the assumption that society is secular. i.e. No pubic figure may wear religious symbols.</p>\n<h5>Secularism and religion</h5>\n<p>Rise of politically active religious movements complicates our ideas about modern life especially when assuming the world's <strong>secular</strong> character.</p>\n<h4>Secularism and religion</h4>\n<p><strong>Religion was not a widely used term</strong>, even by Christians. That is, until the Enlightenment's deployment of the secular/religious distinction.</p>\n<p>Before the Enlightenment it was moreso referred to as \"faith\" and \"tradition\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Today, being secular means:\n<ul>\n<li>Public insititutions should be entirely free from any religious relation</li>\n<li>A framework of nonreligious ideas that is explicitly contrasted with religion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>While assuming that religion has somehow declined and withdrawn from the public sphere, it is wrong to assume that the rest has remained intact</em>.</p>\n<p>What Charles Taylor says is that this is a \"substraction story\". i.e. Quebec schools were once religious, now they are language based. This is not secularization, it is a change.</p>\n<h4>The differentiation of religion from politics</h4>\n<p>The fight against the religious conformity agreed at Westphalia is what led to the European path to secularism.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Westphalia, each state is sovereign without reference to any doctrine such as divine right.</p>\n<h4>Reading discussion</h4>\n<p>Modernization was often done with the exclusion of religion --> this is what is then claimed by secularism.</p>\n<p><strong>Secularization</strong>: Process of transformations that separates religion from public sphere</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) The Theory of <em>mere secularity</em>, that is, the phenomological experience of living in a secular world and in a secular age, where being religious may be a normal viable option</li>\n<li>(b) The Theory of <em>self-sufficient and exclusive secularity</em>, that is, the phenomenological experience of living without religion as a normal, quasi-natural, taken-for-granted condition</li>\n<li>(c) The Theory of <em>secularist secularity</em>, that is, the phenomenological experience not only of being apssively free but also actually of having been liberated from \"religion\" as a condition for human autonomy and human flourishing.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"99d1fa07-e616-5191-818a-1d6d3d74ab2c"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
