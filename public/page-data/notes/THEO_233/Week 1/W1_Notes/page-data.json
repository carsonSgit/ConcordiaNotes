Religion and Politics Worldwide\" that speaks about how countries where people feel insecure (lower quality of life), the people are more religious. In contrast, more \"secure\" countries (i.e. Eastern/Western countries) are <em>less</em> religious. Though, the U.S.A. has ranked <em>2nd</em> in the world for most religious countries.\r\n--> contrasts the major idea in social science where secularization is the future.</p>\n<h3>Rethinking Secularization</h3>\n<p>Craig Calhoun, another influential name in social sciences.</p>\n<p>Calhoun speaks of the \"myth of the secular\" in regards to \"The Peace of Westphalia (1648)\" which brought an end to the \"wars of religion\". Religion became private and did not tie into international relations.</p>\n<p>Calhoun does not see these wars as wars of religion but of \"taxation, state building, and of national states\". Under his view, if one ignores religion as a public matter society loses the power to induct a political reform.\r\n- An example of this is Christian Socialism as demonstrated through Martin Luther King's movement.\r\nBelives that \"religious awakenings\" bring important democratic change (like MLK's movement).\r\nIf we ignore religion and it's effect on the populus (mentality, morals, ideology, etc.), it creates a \"deaf war\" where we cannot understand one another, which leads to an impossibility of hearing out one another.</p>\n<h3>Ranking Secularization</h3>\n<p>Robert Keohane, another influential name.</p>\n<p>He wrote about the 9/11 attacks, stating that we ignore the impact of religion on world events.</p>\n<h3>Rethinking Secularization</h3>\n<p>Charles Taylor states that religious artifacts (churches, monastaries, etc.) prove that we are not secular as separation between church and state, but rather an evolution combined with the decrease in prominence of religion in society.</p>\n<p>Secularization <em>may be</em> a biproduct of western religion.</p>\n<p>Taylor states that religion is not to be blamed for world violence. Wars still happen through things other than religion, hinting that religion is not the root of the issue and that it should be considered as another political ideology.</p>\n<p>To prevent society from falling into disarray, we have things like governments, militaries, etc. Taylor's belief states that religion is another factor into this.</p>\n<h3>How does secularization translate into real life?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Church-state separation</li>\n<li>Twin Tolerations (Reciprocal toleration)</li>\n<li>Government neutrality toward religions</li>\n<li>Pluralism</li>\n<li>Dominant church</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Religion has brought a lot of good to society (education (Oxford, etc.), hospitals)</p>\n<p>*ism => an ideology (i.e. communism, secularism, christianism, etc.)</p>\n<h3>The model of separation of church and state</h3>\n<p>\"<em>The only wall America Needs</em>\"</p>\n<pre><code>            |\r\n            |\r\n            |\r\n    State   |   Church\r\n            |\r\n            |\r\n            |\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Church-state separation</h3>\n<p>Samuel P. Huntington, very influential</p>\n<p>\"the West is different from the Rest because it has embraced the separation of church from state\"- Huntington.</p>\n<p>Believes that there cannot be true democracy without separation of church and state.</p>\n<h3>Alfred Stepan's \"Twin Tolerations\"</h3>\n<p>Ex. Religion and politics should not be intertwined.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion and politics should respect one another</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Government neutrality toward religions</h3>\n<p>Soper, den Dulk, Monsma say that the goal of church-state should be government neutrality toward all forms of religion and religious groups (no favourisation of any religion, lack thereof, or even of secularisation). The government should be neutral in totality in it's views of categorical religion.</p>\n<h3>Western Models of Church-State relations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Strict church-state separation model: Religion should not have intersection within politics (e.g. USA, France)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Established church model: Church and State should collaborate and possess a partnership to advance religion and state together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pluralist model: Society is made of various sectors; education, business, arts, family, etc. Under the pluralist model, religion &#x26; government should also be sectors that society is composed of.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Models of Church-State relations in Eastern Europe</h3>\n<p>Professor's research used 3 models of church-state.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Church-State separation model</li>\n<li>Pluralist Model</li>\n<li>Dominant church model -- Religion demands the loyalty of political parties</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To get to these 3 models, prof analysed the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legislation in regards to religion</li>\n<li>Representation in political sphere of Political Leaders</li>\n<li>Governmental Subsidies</li>\n<li>criteria for official recognition and registration of religions by the government</li>\n<li>Religion in education</li>\n<li>how legislation regarding abortion and homosexuality was negotiated between churches and politicians</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"55dcb228-9c1f-5403-9ef2-c6d773288e74"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
