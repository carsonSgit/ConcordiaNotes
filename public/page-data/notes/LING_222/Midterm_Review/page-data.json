The nature of language tells us that our minds contain knowledge of an abstract system of rules that allows us to <em>generate</em>, that is, produce and understand language. This type of system is called a <em>grammar</em>. The mind is a computational system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nativism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The argument for <strong>innate knowledge</strong>. Some aspects of our Mental Grammar are not learned, but are rather innate (we are born with them). This innate knowledge is sometimes called <em>Universal Grammar</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Constructivism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The argument for the <strong>Construction of Experience</strong>. Our experience of the world is (partially?) dependent upon what our minds bring to perception; we do not experience the physical world directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Internalism and Nativism are Distinct</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mental Grammar = UG + Experience</li>\n<li><strong>UG</strong> refers to innate aspects of this knowledge\n<ul>\n<li>Just because you believe that Mental Grammars exist you do not necessarily believe that it is entirely innate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Experience</strong> refers to the exposure that is needed to convert the initial innate state of the language faculty into a differentiated language faculty. Essentially meaning that Experience converts UG into English, Spanish, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NP</strong>: Noun-Phrase</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Example:\n<ul>\n<li>Largest lake on an island</li>\n<li>Largest island in a lake</li>\n<li>Largest island in a lake on an island in a lake</li>\n<li>Largest island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Empricism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theory of knowledge that emphasizes the role of experience in the formation of ideas. Scientific statements are derived from our experiences and observations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Positivism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Claims to be a fundamentally non-metaphyisical (\"positive\") philosophy, modelled on empirical sciences and providing them with a methodology.</li>\n<li>Positivism is empiricism brought to extreme logical consquences: in as much as knowledge is empircal knowledge, no speculation can be knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>The only knowledge we can have is based upon experience.</strong></li>\n<li>Reject theoretical speculation as means of obtaining knowledge.</li>\n<li>Rules:\n<ul>\n<li>Record only what is manfiested in experience. Rely only upon sense data. Rule out metaphysical or theological bases for verification.</li>\n<li>No generalized constructs or terms that cannot be reconstructed by reference to sense data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>E-Language (external)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language is taken to be a corpus of actual or potential utterances. The grammar is a formal description of this corpus.</li>\n<li>There can be no question of truth---one grammar (description) is as valid as another as they are extensionally equivalent.</li>\n<li>E-Language is consistent with an anti-UG view. Under E-Language, grammars are not properties of individuals, there is no basis for constraining the set of possible languages.</li>\n<li>Implicitly depends on socio-political concept: How do we decide that a corpus is a corpus of a single language?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>P-Language (platonic)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a Platonic ideal that exists independent of actual speakers, meaning for P-Language that within P-English for example, there are words that have never been said before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>I-Language (internalized)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language as a matter of individualized psychology (more concrete than E/P-Language)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Extensional Equivalence</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essentially means that several things generate the same output.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, a stress pattern for one word in Weri is able to be used on all words within the Weri language.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Useful to help determine the best understanding of Universal Grammar\n<ul>\n<li>\"In other words, evidence from one language’s stress system, say</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>that of Weri, should bear on the best analysis of those in other\r\nlanguages, such as Maranungku, since both are forms taken by the\r\ninitial state of the human linguistic stress faculty.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set of sentences/strings.</li>\n<li>The set can be finite/infinite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grammatical/Ungrammatical</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No such thing as an ungrammatical sentence.</li>\n<li>If grammar G generates a string, then that string is a sentence of G.\n<ul>\n<li>If grammar G does not generate a string, then that string is not a sentence of G.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\"Each grammar is related to the corpus in a manner fixed in advance by a given linguistic theory\"</li>\n<li><strong>Grammatical = Generated by the grammar</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Ungrammatical = not generated by the grammar</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>Meaning grammaticality is a relative notion relative to a particular grammar.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grammar</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autonomous.</li>\n<li>Independent of meaning.</li>\n<li>Statistics irrelevant to grammaticality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Finite State Machine</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requirement: Grammar must be finite.</li>\n<li>Each sentence has a finite length.</li>\n<li>No memory.</li>\n<li>No <em>fsg</em> is sufficient for Language.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ALL and ONLY</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need to be sure that these grammars (<em>fsg</em>'s) generate all and <strong>ONLY</strong> the sentences of the language.</li>\n<li>Why is it trivial to generate <strong>ALL</strong> the sentences in these languages?
