Chafe, we see that this is something that also exists in Mohawk. First, it is important to set the scene. Looking at Mohawk language as a non-speaker, it is completely foreign. Analyzing the sentence structure seems completely different from those patterns we see in English, there is reason why Mohawk is a language that many Mohawk teens and young adults do not speak it. Being raised in an assimilated environment of white-culture, there is not only a strong loss in identity but in understanding. </p>\n<p>The reason why we understand English is because it is apart of our Mental Grammar. We implicitly know the patterns, we do not have to look at a sentence and piece it together, it is implicitly computed and understood without any attention. Now looking at Mohawk, we see patterns that differ strongly from English or French. Let's look at an example:</p>\n<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>\r\n<em>Shé:kon Tasatáweia't Skennen'kó:wa ken?</em>\r\n<strong>Literal Translation:</strong>\r\n<em>again toward-you-enter peace-great question</em>\r\n<strong>Accurate Translation:</strong>\r\nHello there. Come on in. How are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong>\r\n<strong>Mohawk:</strong>\r\n<em>Shé:kon Skennen'kó:wa A:ké wakhwisenhé:ion.</em>\r\n<strong>Literal Translation:</strong>\r\n<em>again peace-great oh, my-strength-is-dead</em>\r\n<strong>Accurate Translation:</strong>\r\nHi. I'm fine. A bit tired, though.</p>\n<p><em>Recapturing the Mohawk Language, Mithun &#x26; Chafe, Page 9</em></p>\n<p>Using these two simple sentence examples, we can see the structure, delivery, and meaning differ, especially from English. If Mohawk is not apart of your Mental Grammar, you will not be able to implicitly understand what a word means, where the sentence pauses, or how to build a sentence to communicate. Both Mohawk and English are capability of their primary purpose, facilitating a transfer of information. To understand Mohawk, you simply have to understand the patterns and how to execute that transfer. Below is another example.</p>\n<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>\r\n<em>shará:tats</em>\r\n<strong>Translation:</strong>\r\nYou are lifting it.</p>\n<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>\r\n<em>khará:tats</em>\r\n<strong>Translation:</strong>\r\nI am lifting it.</p>\n<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>\r\n<em>sharáthos</em>\r\n<strong>Translation:</strong>\r\nYou are tipping it over.</p>\n<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>\r\n<em>kkahráthos</em>\r\n<strong>Translation:</strong>\r\nI am tipping it over.</p>\n<p>Now we can start to see and understand the structure and patterns in Mohawk. We have to understand patterns to be able to compute and recognize English, it is the same for all forms of communication in the world. From these examples we can see that both English and Mohawk and discernable patterns when referring to a pronoun for example (I, you), this demonstrates the concept that all forms of communication are built with the same building blocks. What I mean by this is that if we look at language as nothing but symbols to convey a message, with the English \"I\" referring to the self, Mohawk has \"khará\". The concept of language is just an embodiment of communication between one another, and those languages are all built with building blocks that encapsulate things such as pronouns, nouns, etc. All of these building blocks are apart of our mental grammar, and as we all have the ability to communicate, it is a universal grammar.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cad89cb5-74bf-53b3-9d61-3212fb3a6cce"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
