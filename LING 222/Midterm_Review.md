# Review for the Midterm

> Writing answers to study prompts on the midterm review

1. **I-Language. What does I stand for?**

- Internal  
    - The I-Language is a part of your mind so to say. It is not something out there in the word, not physical, not theoretical, it is an internal tool.
- Individual
    - Our I-Languages differ from person to person just as our brains differ. Taking the example of English, my I-Language makes my "understanding" of English differ from yours. 
- Intentional
    - A rule is used to compute the delivery/recognition of stimuli to deliver a certain method.

2. Jackendoff's three fundamental arguments, what are the claims?

- Internalism
    - **The argument for mental grammar**
    - Our minds contain knowledge of an abstract system of rules that allows us to generate/compute.
- Nativism
    - **Argument for innate knowledge**
    - Aspects of our Mental Grammar are not learnt but rather we are born with it. Sometimes called Universal Grammar **(Mental Grammar != Universal Grammar. Mental Grammar = Universal Grammar + Experience)**.
- Constructivism
    - **Argument for the construction of experience**
    - Our minds construct our experience of the world as it perceives it.

3. "Knowledge of language is..." What are the three characteristics?

> BLANK. I DONT KNOW !

4. I-Language != Innate, why?

> BLANK. I DONT KNOW !

5. Mental Grammar and I-Language? How do they relatee to each other?

6. MG = UG + Experience. What does this mean?

7. Intensional vs. Extensional. What is the difference?

8. Equivalence classes.

9. Extensional equivalence, what are the examples?

10. I- vs. E- vs. P-Language, Socio-political and Normative-teleological notions of language.

11. How do we choose between extensionally equivalent grammars (i) if you are an I-Linguist; (ii) if you are an E-Linguist?

12. Lessons from reduplication.

13. What do the following demonstrate?

- Visual illusions (triangles, Necker cube, etc.)
- Class demo from Bregman's Auditory Scene Analysis ("masking effect", African Xylophone music, etc.)
- Word boundaries (the computer assignment)
- *The Star-Spangled Banner* songs

14. Finite State Machines/Grammarss. What can they do? What are the limitations?

15. Can FSMs model English? What implications can we draw from the answer to this question?

16. Technical definition of "grammatical"

17. Modelling a human grammar -- generating ALL and ONLY

18. Over- vs. Under-generate

19. What are these examples for?

- (1a) Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. 
- (1b) Furiously sleep ideas green colorless.

- (8a) You are not allowed running here. 
- (8b) You are not arrowed to run here.
