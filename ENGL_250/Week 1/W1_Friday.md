**IMPORTANT KEYWORD**: Literature

## Literature

- Form of expression
- "elevated kind of expression, on that's invested with sigificant personal and social capital." - Daniel Heath
- study of written fiction, history of written fiction, under the presumption that culture
- Descends from rhetoric and philosophy

## Genre
- Collection of aesthetic conventions
- Marketable traits aimed to apease different demographics' audiences
- Branch of entertainment distinct from literary fiction
- "Beneath real art"
    - "genre fiction is not literature"
- Genre and the distinction from "real literature"

Genre reflects certain traits
    - produces certain traits
    - those traits have their  own values
High Art
    - Transcendent
    - Complex
    - Genius
    - In this view, genre is superficial

Fitting into a "type of literature" is to be sectioned into a genre

Understand the preconceptions held by others in accorddance to their views of your reality -- reading a book of a type of genre -- observe the way

**Plato's Republic**
    - Philosophical book of pseudo-fiction
    - Book X discusses art and literature
        - All art represents the "ideal" 
        - Platonic ideal of a thing exists outside the world --- if anything is to exist, it must be conceived of first --- conceptually perfect --- these ideals are blueprints that we attempt to match, though are only able to create imitations
            - Making fiction distances us from the "ideal", the truth.
        - Narrative and art --- harmful to society
        - Craftsman builds something that mimics art -- mimics the "ideal"

**Sir Philip Sydney**
    - 16th Century english aristocrat, knight/poet/diplomat
    - Genre is an attempt at dumbing down "real literature" --- distancing from Platonic's Ideal
    - Mimesis (imitation of an "ideal") is a good thing
        - Poets have imaginations, they create their own versions
    - 

**Leo Tolstyo**
    - 19th Century Russian Novelist
    - Excommunicated from Russain Orthodox Church in 1901 
    - Purpose of art -- "evolution of feelings takes place by means of art, replacing lower feelings, less kind and less needed for the good of humanity, by kinder feelings, more needed for that good. This is the purpose of art"
    -  

**Oscare Wilde**
    - Irish playwright/poet
    - "All art is quite useless" - *The picture of Dorian Gray*
    - "A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that is to be said about our relation to flowers. Of course man may sell the flower, making it useful to him, but this is not of the nature of the flower, it has nothing to do with it's purpose."
    
**Art as Emotion**
    - Plato says art == poor imitation of the Ideal
    - Sydney says art advances and expands the Ideal
    - Tolstoy + Wilde == art is expression of emotion
        - Tolstoy sees this as sacred
        - Wilde treats it as joy that cannot be captured by ulterior motives

**Focus of this course**
    - Examine what texts are doing.
    - Interested in the effect of the text -- not the purpose but end result.
    - Genre lacks cultural capital.

**Cultural Capital** KEYWORD
    - Resource that can be acrued, invested, paid off as a form of capital through associations with institutes
    - Method of embuing an institue with a form of power (employment, financial, etc.)
    - Literature holds high cultural capital -- helps people measure objects/things associated with the texts
    - Genre/fiction has a lower tier, "cheaper" kind of cultural capital than literature
    - Literature will be approached as political containers of active ideas.

**ASSEMBLAGE** KEYWORD
    - Idea that being and agency emerges from dispersed interactions
        - Not innate qualities
        - Not learned
    - More than the sum of all parts involved
    - EVERYTHING the object comes into contact with (history, creators, associations, emotion, etc.) becomes a part of the text
        - When reading, you bring in yourself to the reading. All of your emotions, thoughts, feelings, personality, etc. gets added *to* that text.
        - Think "entanglement"
    - Nothing at the *core* of the *thing*, just expanded *layers*.
    - An interaction, kept alive as long as it is being read.

**The Novel**
    - Focus of course
    - Prose longform fiction
    - Was a genre, form of "low art"
        - Has been around long enough to acquire enough **cultural capital** to be considered literature
    - Means "new"
        - Origins are contested
    - Popularized as ability to read became more accessible
    - When a culture wants to reject literature as non-serious -- depicted as a "feminine art"

**EPISTEMOLOGY** KEYWORD
    - Knowledge about knowing
    - Theory about where knowledge comes from, how it is curated
        - What knowledge is *allowed* to exist -- what is acceptable
            - i.e. what is socially permissable
        - Related to Ontology - study of being/existing
        - What we are is what we know
    - Literature is a practice of epistemology

**MONOMYTH** KEYWORD
    - i.e. the "Hero's Journey"
    - Master category for all stories
    - Belief that all stories must share a common structure
    - Functionally constrains the idea of creativity and variety in literature
    - Based on **Joseph Campbell's** *Hero with a Thousand Faces* book written in 1949

**Genre and the Monomyth**
    - To maintain the monomyth, difference is ignored or changed to fit the structure
    - Genres are porous and mix with one another
    - Genre is a chance to break free from the conventions of a monomyth
    - Genre is it's own rigid set of conventions
    - Genre means "type", it must be recognizable as the "type" it falls under
        - Therefore it must always fit this category, essentially becoming a miniature monomyth
    - How does genre allow us to expand our understanding of literature and social politics?
    - How does genre free us, yet constrain us to a form of existence?
    - Idealization of the monomyth has a creative violence against other stories, an ostracization of other forms of stories (Indigenous literature, etc.)
        - If you do not fit the monomyth (the story of "One man") then you do not belong to the society, as the monomyth is the encapsulisation of "man"
