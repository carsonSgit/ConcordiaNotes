**Northanger Abbey**

- Written by Jane Austen
- Northhanger Abbey was the first novel she wrote, last she published (6 months after her death)
    - Catherine
        - Young, immature, growing up
        - Gullible but in a endearing way
        - "Training to be a protagonist"
    - Stays with the neighbours
        - Attends balls
    - Catherine as a protagonist
        - Naive, cannot distinguish reality from her horrid novels
    - Like much of Austen's writing, *Northhanger Abbey* is a romance novel
        - Women's literature, concerned with women in society
        - How to fall in love, find friendships, secure a safe future
    - Since has been "reclaimed" as literature

**The Flame and the Flower**

- Maintained as women's literature, but included sex in the primary interests
- Tied sex to violence
- Introduced several reactions for and against it among femininists
- Was the inspiration for many popular forms of literature

**The Case against Romance**

- It's Formulaic
    - So what..... lolz
- Celebrates patriarchy
- Normalizes heterosexual stereotypes
- Educates women to accept gender roles

**The Culture Industry** KEYWORD

- Came from a chapter in Theodore W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer's book *Dialectic of Englightenment* (1947)
- Observed that cultural products were beginning to resemble mass-produced goods
    - Factory produced culture is incapable of substantive critique
    - Celebrates current distribution political power
- When culture becomes commodity, it is vulnerable to monopolization
- A formulaic template to be optimized and mass produced
    - i.e. Mass-production of heteronormative romance stories to reach the largest audience to make the most money

*Romance inculcates women* - General belief of Adorno and Horkheimer

- Romance is a kind of fiction that beats women over her head with what they should believe
    - Love is necessary and romantic love is best
    - Romance love is heterosexual
    - Romantic love is a contest of wills
    - Women's roles in this contest is to guide men with softness and affection

**Reader-Response Theory** KEYWORD

- A responseto formalism
- Posits that the reader is an active participant in creating a text's meaning
    - Reader's subject-position is essential to completing the communication
    - Who the reader is, what they seek, where they are in life, all contribute tothe story
- Reading is always active, and cannot be merely consumptive

*Criticism is a Toolbox*

- No one critical approach is necessarily better than another, they have different uses
    - Texts to an extent must answer for their past
- Critiques made in the Culture Industry don't disappear in Reader-Response

**The Spa**

- Navigating the scripts of gender
- Non-verbal convention through norms
- Negotiating desire
- Cliches repurposed

**Hermeneutics of Paranoia** KEYWORD
