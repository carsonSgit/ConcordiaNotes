## Fantasy

- **Fantasy speculates by making things bigger**
    - More obvious, visible, and subject to critique
    - Beowulf isn't heroic, he is *heroism*
    - Ms. Frisby isn't vulnerable, she is *vulnerability*

- Fantasy doesn't tell you someone is something (i.e. someone is brave, strong, etc.). It shows you.
    - The hero isn't a hero because he is brave, he is the hero because he is the one who is capable of doing X and Y.

- **Suspension of Disbelief** KEYWORD:
    - Willingly turning away from real-world logic
    - Happens in all fiction, primarily fantasy
    - Descends from myth and folklore
    - Many cultures suspend their disbelief in fantasy
    - *We don't need to be convinced that character X has trait Y, we understand it. How does the animal talk? It just does*
