# Fantasy

Fantasy has always been a genre that I enjoyed. Playing D&D as a kid, I was able to immerse myself into worlds like those from my favourite stories. Fantasy has a strong focus on world building in a fantastical yet realistic sense. Based on medieval tales, stories like Lord of The Rings, or games like Skyrim have a sense of immersion, recalling back to the medieval stories left behind in history.
