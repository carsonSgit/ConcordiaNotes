<li>French Revolution: Response to governmental control over aspects of life (including Catholic church being present in government society)</li>
<li>Roman Cathholic Church in France: Catholicism is the most prevalent religion in France by far, though people do not outwardly express their religion (laicite)</li>
<li>Fiffth French Republic Constitution: The Fifth Republic’s system balances power between the executive and legislative branches, with the National Assembly holding a pivotal role in maintaining or dismissing the government.</li>
<li>Gaul: Predecessor to France</li>
<li>Huguenots: French Calvinists, involved in the infamous St. Barthlomew's Massacre (assasination of Huguenots leaders, cassualities of Protestants)</li>
<li>Concordat of 1801: Ended forms of anticlericalism. Conciliatory agreemeent betweeen Napoleon and Opoe Pius VII. Pope gives up claims to confiscated Church Property, Napoleon grants special status of CChurch and pays the clergy. Napoleon also recognizes minority religions.</li>
<li>Rerum Novarum: Publissheed by Pope Leo XIII, reflections on labour and poverty. Social problems musts be addressed by the lowest level of instituional competency.</li>
<li>Alexis de Tocqueville: "Tocuqeville's Revenge" -> increasing reliance of the French government on civil society. Toqueville -> French social observer who believed USA deaelt with threats related to democcracy by mediating through religion and local commuinity, France does not have such networks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Netherlands - Pluralist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anti-Revolutionary Party: Abraham Kuyper, 1879. (theologian / future Prime Minister). Represented Calivinist Christians that opposed liberal/secular influence. Opposed French Revolution's secular ideals -> advocates for government/religious connection and divine order. Important in establishing a "pillarized" society in the Netherlands.</li>
<li>Verzuiling: Pillarization. Divides society into pillars/social communitiess based on religious/ideological differencces. Communities develop independently from one another (often funded by state). Own schools, hospitals, newsspapers, etc. Allows to maintain religious identity while being in a pluralist society.</li>
<li>Rerum Novarum: influenced Dutch Catholic social teachings and the development of Catholic political parties and labor unions. Dutch Catholic leaders drew on Rerum Novarum to argue for social reforms and the rights of workers within a framework of Catholic social thought. The encyclical contributed to the Catholic pillar in Dutch society, encouraging Catholics to engage politically and socially while upholding religious principles.</li>
<li>Government Form: The Netherlands has a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. The Dutch political system is known for its coalition governments, as proportional representation leads to a multiparty system with no single party usually achieving a majority.</li>
<li>Party for Freedom: 2006, Geert Wilders. Strong stance against immigration and Islam's influence in Dutch society, advocating secularism and a reduction in government accommodation for religious groups, especially Muslims. Criticizes the traditional model of pluralism, arguing that it allows incompatible cultural practices to threaten Dutch values.</li>

<li>Titular Head of State: the British Monarch, represented locally (within Australia) by the Governor-General. Represents the ties to Britain, though it is primarily a cceremonial role and the Governor-General does not have much power.</li>
<li>Government Structure: Federal Parliamentary Democracy and Constitutional Monarchy. Federal system -> divides powers between national government and six statess, each having their own parliament. Emphasis on repressentative democracy, coalition-building in a multiparty system, and seecular governance. The federal structure allows states to retain some control over issues like education and health, providing flexibility in managing the needs of a diverse population.</li>
<li>Kevin Rudd's Beliefs: CChristian faith (Anglican). Drew upon his Christian values to address social justice isssues (povert, Indigenous rights). While leaders are typically ssecular, Rudd brought in his Christian belief.</li>
