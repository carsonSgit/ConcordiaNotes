<p>Emperor Theodosius (379-395)
- Gave the Edict Cunctus Populos in 380 CE
- "It is our will that all peoples ruled by our government shall practice that religion (Christianity)"
- Banned all religions other than Christianity
- Much action was put into place to try to make Judaism and Paganism dissapear</p>
<p>Church State Relations in the East
- In the East, collaboration between a Christian Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople
- At the time of Emperor Justinian (6th century), the church recognized the powers of the emperor as protector of the church and preserver of the unity of the faith and asserted it's own authority over the spiritual domain of preserving orthodox doctrine and order in the church
- Emperor was subject to the church's spiritual leadership as far as he was son of the church</p>
<p>Church State Relations in the West
- Period of "Theodosian euphoria" collaboration with curch and state
- Sack of Rome (410 CE) and then the fall of Rome (476 CE)
- Two cities/powers: Understanding of church and state in the West as separate entities, two cities/two powers
- Augustine cahnged his view from that of collaboration with the church and state to that of "Two cities"
- Pope Gelasius: Theory of Two Powers (494 CE)
- In secular matters, bishops should obey the sovereign
- In spiritual matters even emperors must submit to the judgement of the bishops</p>
<p>Why did Rome fall (5th Century)?
- Traditional theory:
- Decadent pagan Rome had to dissapear in order to make room for the new Christian Civilization
- We know this is not true <em>now</em>, was the belief back when
- Assasination theory (20th Century):
- Advancing barbarians killed a perfectly healthy Roman Civilization
- Latest theory:
- Progress and transformations
- Neither decline no decadence but a combination of factors
- Military weakness
- Economic crisis
- Clash between paganism and Christianity
- The might of the barbarian armies</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Augustine</strong>:
- One of the most important Catholic Theologists
- Aurelius Augustinius (354-430 CE)
- Lived all but 5 years in Roman North Africa
- Bishop of Hippo (now Annaba in Algeria) (396-430 CE)
- Highly influential until our time
- Faith
- Reason
- Western mystics, love of God
- The Reformation and Counter-Reformation
- 18th century Enlightenment
- Romantic Movement's emphasis on feeling in Religion
- Synthesis between Christianity and Classic literature
- Psychology, political science, theory of war
- Those influenced by or reacting against Augustine:
- Anselm
- Aquinas
- Petrarch
- Luther
- Bellarmine
- Pascal
- Kierkegaard
- Wittgenstein
- Nietzsche
- Freud
- The formation of Augustine's mind:
- Influenced by the best of Greeks and Romans (Aristotle, Plato, Stoic logic, ethical assertations, Epicurus)
- Neoplatonism captured his mind when he was 31: Plotinus (205-270 CE)
- For a while, follower of Manichaeism, a Gnostic school
- Philisophical thinking is needed for any critical judgement, even for people involved in public and political life
- Plotinus declared that evil is a defect of being and goodness (unlike the Manichees which all Neoplatonists hated)
- Two other explanations for evil:
- Misused free choice grounded in potentiality for weakness in the soul
- Weakness in the soul tended to make it absorbed in external, material things
- Jesus
- Reading Cicero led Augustine to Manicheism, reading PLotinus and Prophyry led him to Jesus Christ
- Young Augustine became convinced that Christianity is nothing but "Platonism for the Masses"</p>
<p>Augustine's Civitas Dei (City of God)
- Single scriptural theme, illuminated and made the basis for an extended meditation on the whole message of revelation itself
- The fall of angels and humans, itself the result of a deragement of loves, has brought schism into the soul of man
- In the natural state, man is now a stranger to himself, incapable of self-knowledge; thinking himself good and virtuous but in reality -> full of pride and disordered loves
- Left to itself, human society would be nothing but the city of this world, cut off from God, destined to die in body and soul</p>
<p>Augustine's view of secularism and religion
- Secular is not contrasted with religion but with eternity
- Secular comes from the Latin saeculum (French "Siecle"), a unity of time introduced by Etruscans and adopted by the Romans
- In the Middle Ages, "Secular" referred to the affairs of a worldy existence and used for clergy not attached to religious orders (e.g. a parish priest was a secular priest)
- Augustine spoke of the saeculum as a mixed, inextricably intertwined state in this temporal life</p>
<h4>Augustine "City of God"</h4>
<ul>
<li>Brings comparison to discern what is "right" and what is "wrong"
<ul>
<li>A pirate is a robber, while an emperor is a king</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Desire/Attachment to things is a root to "evil" (sadness, violence, etc.)
<ul>
<li>Being very very wealthy -> fear of losing the wealth</li>
<li>Attached to growth -> wars for new territory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>R. Markus "Augustine and the Secularisation of Rome"</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trying to replace all other religions with Christianity
<ul>
<li>"Christian Euphoria"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Augustine preached
<ul>
<li>In past: "Christianity is in prosperity" type of preaching</li>
<li>Then: Christianity is going through an "identity crisis"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A growth of aestheticism
<ul>
<li>Monks</li>
<li>Dedicating life to god
<ul>
<li>Leaving cities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Political leaders would write letters to Christian Leaders:
<ul>
<li>"Stop sending people to go devote their lives to god"
<ul>
<li>People are leaving, population decreasing, economy suffering</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coming face to face with barbarians, feeling fear and uncertainty</li>
<li>Augustine writes the "City of God" in response</li>
<li>"Christians have always known that with the coming of Christ comes with a new Age"
<ul>
<li>This is the New Age Augustine speaks about
<ul>
<li>Augustine is opposed to the idea that we should figure out when the "end" will be</li>
<li>This is a period of mixed realities:
<ul>
<li>Society is corrupt</li>
<li>People trying to live moral lives to be able to live in the city of god</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Culture is for material &#x26; earthly matters</li>
<li>Opposes Paganism</li>
</ul>
