<p><strong>The argument for mental grammar:</strong> The expressive variety of language use implies that a language user's brain contains unconscious grammatical principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentence variation</li>
<li>System of Rules (unconscious rules that must be followed)</li>
<li>Structure and Hierarchhies</li>
<li>Implicit knowledge</li>
<li>Productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Jackendoff's argument of mental grammar, we are able to create an infinite amount of sentences that may differ in any amount in regards to delivery, while still leaving the message unchanged. Given the core sentence of "Susan walked to the store", we can change things around and bring in some different wording for the same message "Susan made her way to the store". We can also recursively add in new sentences, for example "Susan woke up at 8:10AM and made her way to the store" which then can also be changed to "Susan woke up at 8:10AM and, despite being tired, made her way to the store". This can be done infinitely many ways while maintaining the message of the sentence. However this sort of variation and recursion only works as it respects the rules of mental grammar.</p>
<p>If we change the sentence "Henry ate a bowl of Cheerios" to "Cheerios Henry bowl ate a", we lose all comprehension of the sentence's message. This is because internally, unconsciously, we have a system of rules that lets us generate and compute sentences to be understood, so when a sentence completely disregards those rules, it loses the ability to make sense.</p>
<p>Mental grammar allows us to understand sentences of varying lengths and complexities regardless of whether or not they are familiar. For example, "The sonnet delivered at the Communion last Sunday reminded me of Shakespeare's <em>Romeo &#x26; Juliet</em>, specifically near the end of it when they both ended in a tragic fate". This sentence, while referencing multiple different things and bringing the readers attention from one thing to another, still is coherent and comprehensible.</p>
<p>Jackendoff argues that this is entirely an implicit knowledge, we aren't told that our sentence should follow the structure and hierarchy that makes sense to us though we follow these rules unconsciously.</p>
<h2>Notes about Mohawk story</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multilingual</li>
<li>Easily converse between one another through different languages</li>
<li>La Prairie 1667, town close-by Montreal to house "praying Indians"</li>
<li>Moved to Caughnawaga Reserve by 1719</li>
<li>Some moved farther, to Akwesasne from 1755-1759</li>
<li>Assimilation, enforcement of white-culture</li>
<li>Most people who speak Mohawk are the adults (30-40 years old) or young children
<ul>
<li>Teenagers and young adults grew up only learning English</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the issue continues, it will lead to the loss of many ancestrual Native languages (less practicers in already small population = loss of use)</li>
<li>Mohawk is not an easy language to learn, it's structure and grammar differ massively from English which makes it hard for the Mohawk people who grew up only knowing English to learn the language</li>
<li>Reversed sentence structure to English</li>
<li><em>Mohawk is not innate to those who did not grow up for it (native language)</em></li>
<li>Mohawk is a different delivery than English, though it is still apart of Universal Grammar. Communicating from the Mohawk language is an implicity ability of those who "know" Mohawk
<ul>
<li>Just as how people may implicitly know English</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is hard to "learn" Mohawk, yet people still know how to communicate in the language, why?
<ul>
<li>Mohawk was apart of <em>their</em> upbringing to then form with their Mental Grammar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People do not have to know every word within the Mohawk Language, you simply have to understand the patterns. In English, we have drop/dropped, just as how they have in Mohawk, it is simply executed differently</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading the text "Recapturing the Mohawk Language" by Marianne Mithun &#x26; Wallace L. Chafe, we see that this is something that also exists in Mohawk. First, it is important to set the scene. Looking at Mohawk language as a non-speaker, it is completely foreign. Analyzing the sentence structure seems completely different from those patterns we see in English, there is reason why Mohawk is a language that many Mohawk teens and young adults do not speak it. Being raised in an assimilated environment of white-culture, there is not only a strong loss in identity but in understanding. </p>
<p>The reason why we understand English is because it is apart of our Mental Grammar. We implicitly know the patterns, we do not have to look at a sentence and piece it together, it is implicitly computed and understood without any attention. Now looking at Mohawk, we see patterns that differ strongly from English or French. Let's look at an example:</p>
<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>
<em>Shé:kon Tasatáweia't Skennen'kó:wa ken?</em>
<strong>Literal Translation:</strong>
<em>again toward-you-enter peace-great question</em>
<strong>Accurate Translation:</strong>
Hello there. Come on in. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>
<strong>Mohawk:</strong>
<em>Shé:kon Skennen'kó:wa A:ké wakhwisenhé:ion.</em>
<strong>Literal Translation:</strong>
<em>again peace-great oh, my-strength-is-dead</em>
<strong>Accurate Translation:</strong>
Hi. I'm fine. A bit tired, though.</p>
<p><em>Recapturing the Mohawk Language, Mithun &#x26; Chafe, Page 9</em></p>
<p>Using these two simple sentence examples, we can see the structure, delivery, and meaning differ, especially from English. If Mohawk is not apart of your Mental Grammar, you will not be able to implicitly understand what a word means, where the sentence pauses, or how to build a sentence to communicate. Both Mohawk and English are capability of their primary purpose, facilitating a transfer of information. To understand Mohawk, you simply have to understand the patterns and how to execute that transfer. Below is another example.</p>
<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>
<em>shará:tats</em>
<strong>Translation:</strong>
You are lifting it.</p>
<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>
<em>khará:tats</em>
<strong>Translation:</strong>
I am lifting it.</p>
<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>
<em>sharáthos</em>
<strong>Translation:</strong>
You are tipping it over.</p>
<p><strong>Mohawk:</strong>
<em>kkahráthos</em>
<strong>Translation:</strong>
I am tipping it over.</p>
<p>Now we can start to see and understand the structure and patterns in Mohawk. We have to understand patterns to be able to compute and recognize English, it is the same for all forms of communication in the world. From these examples we can see that both English and Mohawk and discernable patterns when referring to a pronoun for example (I, you), this demonstrates the concept that all forms of communication are built with the same building blocks. What I mean by this is that if we look at language as nothing but symbols to convey a message, with the English "I" referring to the self, Mohawk has "khará". The concept of language is just an embodiment of communication between one another, and those languages are all built with building blocks that encapsulate things such as pronouns, nouns, etc. All of these building blocks are apart of our mental grammar, and as we all have the ability to communicate, it is a universal grammar.</p></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/notes/LING_222/ReactionPaper1_Notes/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
