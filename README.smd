# Concordia Notes
Notes taken for my courses at Concordia University.

Made a little website to display them for easier access, if you're interested in doing the same yourself, feel free to steal my code (all you have to do really is make your own files/folders in the `Notes` directory) or ask me for some help to set it up!
