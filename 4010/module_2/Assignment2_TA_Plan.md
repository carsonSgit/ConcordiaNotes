## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the assessment of Fundica's AI-Powered Funding Matching System following CTO approval of the technology recommendation. The 12-week assessment will evaluate the core matching technology, identify enhancement opportunities from emerging AI capabilities, and inform fiscal year 2026-2027 investment decisions.

The assessment addresses Braun's first three steps: defining scope and timeline, documenting the technology with alternatives, and analyzing core questions regarding benefits and strategic fit. A five-member team with ML, architecture, and fintech expertise will execute the assessment at an estimated incremental cost of $38,000.

Key deliverables include technology documentation, alternative analysis, risk assessment, and strategic recommendations. The assessment will provide management with objective data to maintain Fundica's competitive position in the financial technology sector.
