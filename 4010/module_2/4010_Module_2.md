## Lesson 3: What is Technology Assessment?

### The Heart of Technology Assessment

Understanding the scope of a Technology Assessment (TA) requires understanding:
- What TA means
- Its purpose
- Why it is needed

### Why Technology Assessment?

> "The competitive success of today's business clearly depends on the use of technology. Modern organisations face the dual challenge of keeping up with rapidly changing technology."
> — White, 1998

### Purpose of Technology Assessment

- In general terms: The means of **evaluating a particular technology or its use**
- Focuses toward evaluating a specific technology for its intended, **measurable purpose**

### Evaluating Specific Technologies

- Evaluating technology is **subjective and philosophical**
- TA focuses on evaluating a specific technology for its intended purpose that can be measured
- Most assessments focus on how the technology will fulfill its purpose

### Key Assessment Considerations

#### Technical Merit
- Ensure technology is **"fit-for-purpose"**
- Meets all technical requirements
- Assess full effect on the broader organization
- Consider environmental issues surrounding the technology

#### Non-Technical Criteria
| Category | Considerations |
|----------|---------------|
| Society | Social impacts, public acceptance |
| Environment | Environmental effects, sustainability |
| Political | Regulatory compliance, government support |

> **Important:** Avoid selecting a technology solely on technical merit. Non-technical criteria must be equally considered.

### Competitive Technology Deployment

For a firm to be fully competitive:
- Technology must not be deployed just to fulfill a narrow, specific task
- The objective is to consider technology in its **full context** with all:
  - Opportunities
  - Possibilities
  - Ramifications for the firm and environment

### Braun's Definition of Technology Assessment

> "A systemic approach to foresee the consequences of introducing a particular technology in all spheres it is likely to interact with."

This definition is broad enough to understand how involved technology assessments truly are.

### US Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)

- Created by US Congress to develop an interdisciplinary organization
- **Mandate:** Produce future-oriented advice on the full spectrum of consequences of technology application
- **Key principle:** With proper scientific rigor by appropriate experts, risks could be mitigated
- **Status:** Closed in 1995 due to budget constraints

### Subjectivity in Technology Assessment

- What TA means can be very subjective
- Different meanings to different organizations and industries
- How an organization conducts a TA will vary based on:
  - Industry type
  - Technology being assessed
  - Organizational context

### TA Risk Mitigation

> In reality, no one can fully predict all the future effects a technology implementation will have. However, with proper scientific rigor by the appropriate experts, the risk could be mitigated.

---

## Lesson 4: Technology Assessment Methodology/Planning

### Technology Assessment Planning

- Covers the planning aspects required to conduct a technology assessment
- **Critical insight:** Majority of technology assessments fail to meet their intended purpose due to **poor planning**

### Role of the Assessor

As the assessor, you must:
- Develop a robust plan **prior to** conducting the assessment
- Master planning aspects such as:
  - Resource management
  - Scheduling
  - Risk management

### Braun's 5 Steps for Conducting a Technology Assessment

TA was originally developed as an aid to public policy formation, but principles apply equally to management decisions. The methodologies are consistent regardless of domain, industry, or technology.

**STIP Framework:** Scope, Technology, Impacts, Policy

---

### Step 1: Topic, Scope and Time

#### Addressing the Topic
- First address the topic for assessment
- Is it a **technology** or a **social issue**?
- Determine: Technology-oriented problem OR Problem-oriented TA

#### Defining Scope
- Must define a well-defined scope
- **Too narrow:** Will not address the goal of the TA
- **Too wide:** Will become too costly and unyielding

#### Time Requirements
- Define time requirements in the form of:
  - Detailed schedule
  - Gantt chart
  - Timeline
- Defining and scheduling activities is crucial for any TA

---

### Step 2: Technology Description

#### Key Elements
1. **Definition of the technology** under scrutiny
2. **Description of alternatives** - technologies that can fulfill the same function
3. **Complementary and rival technologies**
4. **Development paths** for the technology

#### Good Descriptors
- Performance characteristics
- Principles of operation
- Cost factors

#### Language Requirements
- Must be **technically sound**
- Easily understood by anyone within the industry
- Accessible at **management levels**

#### Forecasting Element
- Foresee where the technology is going
- Consider development of rivals and complements

> **Step 2 Summary:** "What is the technology we are talking about, how does it fit into the technological system and how is it likely to be developed?"

---

### Step 3: Core Questions

#### Key Questions to Address
1. What **benefits** are to be expected?
2. What **needs** (or strategic goals) does it satisfy?
3. Why is it **superior** to present or rival technologies?

#### Value Judgement
- Apply value judgement on positive aspects
- Assess commercial viability
- Evaluate public, political, and social benefits

> **Step 3 Summary:** "What benefits are of the technology and who will they accrue?"

---

### Step 4: Unwanted Effects and Hazards

#### Focus Areas
- Undesirable effects or hazards the technology might present
- When identified: Who will they affect? How can they be mitigated?

#### Categories of Danger
- Environment
- Human health
- Society
- Other triggering events

#### Risk Definition Requirements
- Define risks in **qualitative** terms (descriptive)
- Define risks in **quantitative** terms (measurable)

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Likelihood | Insignificant | Minor | Moderate | Major | Catastrophic |
|------------|--------------|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Almost Certain** | Medium | High | High | Extreme | Extreme |
| **Likely** | Low | Medium | High | High | Extreme |
| **Possible** | Low | Medium | Medium | High | Extreme |
| **Unlikely** | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Rare** | Low | Low | Low | Medium | High |

#### Using the Risk Matrix
1. For each risk identified, assign an impact based on the matrix
2. Example: Technology affects human health, likelihood is rare, consequence is major = **Medium Risk**
3. Rank all risks in a table with their impact level

#### Expert Knowledge
- This step requires significant experience and knowledge
- TAs document the technology but don't provide better answers than industry experts
- Provides detailed summary and analysis of expert opinions and experience

> **Step 4 Summary:** "What dangers the technology may harbour and what ill effects might it cause?"

---

### Step 5: Policy Analysis

#### Focus Areas
- Political impacts or supports required for the technology
- Some technologies may need help from:
  - Government programmes
  - Legislative/regulatory measures
  - Administrative or provincial arrangements

#### Compliance Considerations
- Global and national controls (e.g., emission controls)
- Industry standards
- Certification requirements
- Training costs within the organization

#### Objectivity Requirement
- This step is difficult to be subjective
- TA should be as **objective as possible**
- Avoid giving advice based on findings
- Lay out what needs to be done and why

> **Step 5 Summary:** "What support or control might be needed for the technology and what options are available for providing them?"

---

### Planning Work Tasks

Planning the assessment ensures:
- The assessment is **effective** in meeting its goals
- The assessment and subsequent activities proceed **on schedule**
- The costs are **established in advance** and not exceeded

#### Work Task Checklist

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Identify Goals | Define what the assessment aims to achieve |
| 2. Identify Major Issues | Determine key challenges and concerns |
| 3. Decide Scope | Determine level of effort to be applied |
| 4. Develop Product/Project Description | Include alternatives |
| 5. Consider Ancillary Projects | Identify supporting projects if any |
| 6. Develop Report Format | Structure for the assessment report |
| 7. Organize Project Team | Assemble required expertise |
| 8. Develop Schedule | Create control system for the assessment |

---

## Lesson 5: Alternative Evaluation and Generation

### Alternative Evaluation Overview

- One subject that comes to mind during **all stages** of a TA
- Looking at alternative technologies that meet stated goals and objectives
- Part of the planning process AND execution/reporting stages

### When to Conduct Alternative Evaluation

Alternative evaluation should be looked at **throughout all stages** because:
- Technologies change and innovations occur daily
- Organization and corporate goals/objectives can change
- Constraints (political, financial, safety, etc.) can change

> **Always be aware of alternatives whenever you can!**

### Government Requirements

- Generation of project alternatives is required in many Federal and Provincial environmental assessment processes
- Provides government reviewers a preferred project alternative for comparison
- Prevents proponents from presenting reports focused only on merits of their preferred method

### Types of Alternatives

#### Structural vs Non-Structural

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Structural** | Physical variations of the project/product | Stainless steel tank vs. plastic tank |
| **Non-Structural** | Non-physical, institutional, or operational modifications | Process changes, policy adjustments |

#### Production vs Product Alternatives

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Alternatives to the Product/Project** | Broad set of alternatives to achieve firm's goals |
| **Alternative Methods of Developing** | Variations of particular alternatives |

### Electric Car Case Study Example

**Proponent's Goal:** Reducing emissions from urban traffic

| Alternatives to Product/Project | Alternative Methods of Developing |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Do Nothing | Do Nothing |
| Encourage Alternate Modes (Buses, Streetcars, Carpooling) | Existing infrastructure |
| Different Alternate Transports | Alcohol Powered, Hovercraft, Nuclear |
| Modify Scale of Vehicle | Scooter, Light duty, Bus |
| | Modify Power Source (Plug-in, Solar) |
| | Modify Development Schedule |

### Goals Identification

- **Fundamental** to generation and evaluation of alternatives
- Effective evaluative measures can only be formulated after goals are established
- Key customer requirements should drive alternatives
- Goals of affected groups may be totally or partially incompatible

### Strawman Alternative

**Definition:** An alternative that does not fulfill the goal of the project or is substantially worse than other alternatives

**Two Common Failings:**
1. Failure to consider the "null hypothesis" (do nothing option)
2. Inclusion of strawman alternatives

### Continual Development of Alternatives

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Generation    │◄──────┐
│  of Alternatives│       │
└────────┬────────┘       │
         │                │
         ▼                │
┌─────────────────┐       │
│   Evaluation    │       │
│  of Alternatives│───────┘
└─────────────────┘
     Feedback Process
```

- Generation is not conducted solely at the outset
- As information emerges through evaluation:
  - New alternatives may be conceived
  - Existing ones will be redefined and modified

### Alternative Evaluation Analysis

#### Key Principle
> A TA does not make a decision, but presents the facts! The TA is an impartial analysis to help managers and politicians make a decision.

#### Prerequisites for Evaluation
1. A number of plans or courses of action must be available
2. Types and magnitude of impacts must be known for each alternative
3. Goals by which alternatives will be assessed must be well defined

#### Evaluation Process Should:
- Review and clarify goals or problems
- Propose alternative means of achieving goals
- Assess extent to which alternatives meet stated goals
- Assess effort and resources necessary
- Reveal probability of intended and unintended consequences
- Conduct evaluation objectively
- Assess differences between impacts and goals of affected groups

---

### Decision Making Conditions

| Condition | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Certainty** | Consequences of each course of action are known with absolute certainty |
| **Risk** | Probability that a consequence will occur is known |
| **Uncertainty** | Probability that a consequence will occur is unknown |

---

### Evaluation Techniques Summary

| Technique | Type | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **Scenarios** | Goal Implicit | Alternatives generation; used with impact assessment |
| **Minimax, Maximax, Minimax Regret** | Goal Implicit | Alternatives selection under uncertainty |
| **Decision Trees** | Goal Implicit | Alternatives selection under risk |
| **Cost-Benefit Analysis** | Goal Implicit | Evaluation where monetary values can be assigned |
| **Balance Sheet** | Goal Implicit | General alternatives evaluation |

---

### Goal Explicit vs Goal Implicit Methods

#### Goal Explicit Methods
- Compare courses of action based on goals/objective achievement
- Example: Goals Achievement Matrix
- **Advantage:** Demand goals and evaluative measures be well-defined

#### Goal Implicit Methods
- Refer to goals hierarchy only implicitly
- Greater emphasis on analysis of consequences vs. goal achievement
- Most common techniques used
- **Danger:** Goals hierarchy may never be adequately defined

---

### Scenarios

**Definition:** A hypothetical sequence of events intended to focus attention on pivotal future events and decision points

#### Characteristics
- Deal with ongoing processes
- Descriptive, often dramatizing the future
- More open to public participation and debate

#### Two Key Questions
1. How might the course of action result in potential future situations?
2. What options exist at each step to prevent, divert, or facilitate the process?

#### Considerations
- Wide variety of distinct scenarios covering reasonable range of actions and effects
- Should encompass variety of public opinions
- Should have reasonable chance of occurring

---

### Minimax, Maximax, and Minimax Regret

Used when there are known possible alternatives but **probability of occurrence is unknown**.

#### Minimax Criterion
- Assumes **worst possible outcome** will always occur
- Select alternative with the "best-worst" outcome
- In other words: **the best bad solution**

#### Maximax Criterion
- Assumes **best possible outcome** will occur
- Select alternative with the "best-best" outcome
- **Warning:** Very risky; not suitable where significant adverse consequences are possible

#### Minimax Regret Criterion
- Minimizes the 'regret' from consequences of a decision
- **Regret:** Difference between best and worst outcome of an alternative
- Select the alternative having minimum regret

#### Example: City Dump Site Selection

| Site | Development Cost | Well Relocation Cost | Total (Without Well) | Total (With Well) |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| A | $1M | $14M | $1M | $15M |
| B | $3M | $7M | $3M | $10M |
| C | $7M | $2M | $7M | $9M |

**Results:**
- **Minimax:** Site C with well relocation ($9M) - assume worst case
- **Maximax:** Site A without well relocation ($1M) - best case
- **Minimax Regret:** Site C - minimizes cost of a mistake

---

### Decision Trees

Used for making decisions under conditions of **risk** (probabilities known).

#### Requirements
- Know probability of every possible consequence
- Able to place a value (usually money) on each outcome

#### Expected Value (EV)
- Central concept of decision trees
- Expected long-term or average value
- **Formula:** EV = Probability × Value (summed for all outcomes)

#### Example: Die Roll Game
- Pay $1 if roll 1, 2, or 3 (P = 0.5)
- Receive $2 if roll 4, 5, or 6 (P = 0.5)
- **EV** = (0.5 × -$1) + (0.5 × $2) = $0.50

#### Decision Tree Example: New Product Development

| Development | Market Reaction | Probability | Return | Cost |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|------|
| **Thorough** | Good | 40% | $1,000,000 | $150,000 |
| | Medium | 40% | $50,000 | |
| | Fail | 20% | $2,000 | |
| **Rapid** | Good | 10% | $1,000,000 | $80,000 |
| | Medium | 20% | $50,000 | |
| | Fail | 70% | $2,000 | |

**EV Calculation for Thorough Development:**
- (0.4 × $1,000,000) + (0.4 × $50,000) + (0.2 × $2,000) = **$420,400**
- Net EV = $420,400 - $150,000 = $270,400

---

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Widely used technique comparing alternatives on an **economic basis**.

#### Definitions
- **Benefits:** Positive (gains) or negative (losses) resulting from a decision
- **Costs:** Total input (labour, capital, resources) required to implement the proposal

#### Steps
1. Evaluate and add up all **benefits** for each option
2. Evaluate and add up all **costs** for each option
3. Compare the **benefit-cost ratio** (benefit divided by cost)

---

## Lesson 6: Contemporary Problems with Technology

### TA Planning Effects

- Planning naturally leads to technology assessment activities subconsciously
- Technologists generally focus on **functional merits** rather than non-functional impacts
- This tendency must be consciously overcome

### Technology Implementation Impacts

#### Short-term Effects
- Positive improvements to organizational efficiencies
- Process improvements
- General quality of life improvements

#### Long-term Effects (Difficult to Predict)
- Environmental impacts
- Socio-economic impacts
- Macro-economic impacts from technology and innovation

### Environmental Impacts

In today's society, environmental impacts are **publicly and politically sensitive**:
- Noise pollution
- Air pollution
- Water pollution
- Soil pollution/erosion
- Traffic pollution
- Waste management

### Environmental Assessments

#### Regulatory Framework
- Each country has environmental assessment acts and policies
- Regional and international project considerations
- Excellent source of information for conducting environmental assessments
- If operating in a foreign country, must be aware of that country's regulations

#### Canadian Environmental Assessment Act

Updated in June 2010, meant for assessment of high-profile projects.

> "Environmental assessment provides an effective means of integrating environmental factors into planning and decision-making processes in a manner that promotes sustainable development."

### Key Takeaway

Consider these broader effects, particularly during the **technology assessment planning stages**, when defining the scope of the technology assessment.
