## Lesson 1: Technology and Innovation
*The "What" of Technology Assessments*

### The Role of Technology Managers

> "Technology Managers are the heart to managing technologies within industry."

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Engineers/Scientists:** Design and develop technologies to give an organization the *opportunity* to benefit from a technology
- **Technology Managers:** Reap the benefits of a technology and *realize* those benefits

Technology managers are involved in all stages of the technology delivery process, from inception to disposal.

### Technology Lifecycle (5 Stages)

#### Stage Descriptions:

1. **Technology Inception**
   - Developing the requirements to implement a new technology
   - Requirements usually support the firm's strategic goals, objectives, and vision

2. **Technology Assessment**
   - Identification, prediction, evaluation, and presentation of resulting effects
   - Evaluates proposed project or product and its alternatives
   - Product or project that meets technology requirements

3. **Technology Delivery**
   - Delivery of a product or project meeting specific requirements from inception phase
   - Normally follows formal project delivery processes
   - Includes elements such as product, logistics, training, etc.

4. **Technology Management**
   - Coordinating and controlling activities to ensure technology serves its best interest
   - Manages operational life of the technology
   - Managed by a specialist in the associated technology

5. **Technology Disposal/Replacement**
   - Activity to determine if technology still fulfills original intended purpose
   - Assess if suitable replacement is required

### Defining Technology

#### Bush's Definition (1981)
> "Technology is a form of human cultural activity that applies the principles of science and mechanics to the solution of problems. It includes the resources, tools, processes, personnel, and systems developed to perform tasks and create immediate particular, and personal and/or competitive advantages in a given ecological, economic, and social context."
>
> — Bush, C. L. (1981). *Taking hold of technology: Topic guide for 1981-1983.* Washington, DC: American Association of University Women.

#### Braun's Definitions (Broader)
> "Technology is the way and means by which humans produce purposeful material artifacts and effects."

Or alternatively:

> "The material artifacts used to achieve some practical human purpose and knowledge needed to produce and operate such artifacts."

### Types of Technology

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Process Technology** | Technology used to manufacture a firm's products | Automated assembly line |
| **Product Technology** | Technology used within a firm's product that makes it unique | iPhone camera and software |

### Technological Systems
- A complex set of devices and material artifacts serving some practical purpose
- Examples: Railway systems, airports
- Boundaries of these systems are arbitrary
- Note: Technological *knowledge* is not a technology itself

### Purpose of Technology
- Technologies serve to fulfill a purpose
- Technology assessments generally evaluate against purpose
- Assessments must distinguish between technology and its purpose

### Technology Innovation

#### Two Major Forces Driving Technology Change:
1. **Science/Improvement** - No technology is perfect; it will always require improvement
2. **Economic** - New technology improvements are critical for economic growth

#### Directions of Technology Change:
- Higher performance
- Increased customer satisfaction

### Invention vs. Innovation

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Invention** | A technology that does not exist (creating something new) |
| **Innovation** | An improvement and/or change in an existing technology |

### Four Classifications of Innovation (Freeman & Perez, 1988)

1. **Incremental Innovations**
   - Relatively small changes in technology
   - Usually considered a re-design of existing technology
   - Occur continuously in any industry or service activity
   - Result of learning by doing, using, and interacting

2. **Radical Innovations**
   - Greater leaps in product or process technology
   - Usually result of research and development (R&D)
   - Discontinuous events
   - Unevenly distributed over sectors and time

3. **Technology System Innovations**
   - Even larger innovative changes
   - Can cause managerial and organizational change
   - Affect several branches of the economy
   - Based on combination of radical and incremental innovations with organizational innovations

4. **Techno-Economic Paradigm (Technological Revolutions)**
   - Extremely large changes affecting entire economies
   - Far-reaching effects on behavior of the entire economy
   - Has *pervasive* effects throughout the economy
   - Represents a "meta-paradigm"

### Process and Product Innovations
- **Process technology innovations:** Changes to the way in which production takes place
- **Product innovations:** More direct impact for the individual; net improvement on tasks performed by the technology

### Economic Factors in Technology Innovation

#### Macro-Economic Factors
- Broad and general aspects of an economy
- Technology innovation has very broad economic effects
- Technology managers must be aware of these forces
- Important to understand macro-economic effects when assessing technology

#### Micro-Economic Factors
- Focused on net effects a technology has on individual businesses or organizations
- Crucial for analyzing technology decision-making (assessment) process
- Very important for technology managers to understand

### Major Socio-Economic Periods in Technology

| Period | Key Technologies |
|--------|------------------|
| 1770-1830 | Textile innovations and steam power |
| 1830-1880 | Railway and steel |
| 1880-1940 | Electricity, internal combustion engine, chemical industry |
| 1940-1980 | Pharmaceuticals, plastics, television, electronics |
| 1980-present | Microelectronics, computers, telecommunications, bioengineering |

### Product Development Stages

```
Product Idea → Basic Research → Invention → Early Stage Technology Development → Product Development (Innovations) → Production, Marketing, and Sales
```

## Lesson 2: Strategic Management of Technology
*The "Why" of Technology Assessments*

### Peter Drucker on Management
Peter Drucker (1909-2005), recognized as the "Father of Modern Management":
- Managers are the basic resource of the organization
- A primary function and responsibility of management is strategic planning
- Note: Drucker did not focus extensively on the role of technology and technology managers

### Two Main Elements of Strategy

#### 1. Strategic Planning (The Activity)
An organizational management activity used to:
- Set priorities
- Focus energy and resources
- Strengthen operations
- Ensure employees and stakeholders work toward common goals
- Establish agreement around intended outcomes/results
- Assess and adjust the organization's direction in response to a changing environment

> "It is a disciplined effort that produces fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization is, who it serves, what it does, and why it does it, with a focus on the future."

#### 2. Strategic Plan (The Document)
- Result of strategic planning activity
- Core document for organization's focus to make business decisions
- Provides direction to employees
- CEO's tool to communicate mission, values, and long-term objectives/goals

**Strategic Plan Components:**
- Company's mission
- Values
- Goals and objectives
- Broad plan of current state and desired future state
- Detailed action plan
- Resources assigned to the plan

### Peter Drucker's Definition of Strategy
Strategy is:
1. The *continuous* process of making present risk-taking decisions systematically with the greatest knowledge of their futurity
2. Organizing systematically the efforts needed to carry out these decisions
3. Measuring the results of these decisions against expectations through organized, systematic feedback

### What a Strategic Plan Is
- The process by which leaders determine what the organization intends to be in the future and how it will get there
- Closely aligned to long-range planning
- Focused on how the company will achieve its elements
- The development of a vision for the company's future

### What a Strategic Plan Is NOT
- A box of tricks or bundle of techniques
- Forecasting
- An attempt to eliminate risks

### Why Strategic Plans Fail (Napier)
1. **The unknowable future** - Uncertainty in prediction
2. **Narrow thinking** - Technology is not a key consideration
3. **Participation and personal commitment** - Technology managers need to be involved up front
4. **Invisible leaders** - Technologists are generally undervalued

### Technology Manager's Role in Strategic Planning
- Senior management tends to overlook the importance of technology managers in strategic planning
- Technology managers are crucial during the *entire* strategic planning process
- Technology managers are crucial not only in delivery and support, but throughout the planning process

### Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- Primary Technology Manager responsible for laying out technology strategy/plan
- Delivers technology requirements of the Strategic Plan
- Technology assessment becomes part of strategic planning process
- Key for success in any firm regardless of industry

### Strategic Management of Technology
> "Strategic Management of Technology is concerned with the management of technology to fit within the Strategic Plan."

Technology is selected and/or assessed in a way that suits:
- Organizational culture
- Vision
- Goals

The planning process determines technology capabilities required to meet the organization's future vision.

### Technology Plan
- Sub-document of the strategic plan
- CTO is usually in charge of developing this document

> "Technology plan must provide the right technology to produce the right products at the right price."

The plan provides:
- Technologies an organization is going to adapt
- Timeframe for implementation

### Three Main Functions of Technology Managers
1. Information gathering and analysis
2. Preparation of planning proposals
3. Implementation of plan

### Role of Technology in Commercial Firms (Braun)
Three fundamental areas where technologies have strategic significance:
1. Production and process technology
2. Infrastructure and ancillary technology
3. Technology in service organizations

### Porter's Seven Steps for Technology Analysis

Michael Porter recommends seven steps to analyze technology as a strategic tool:

1. **Identify technologies in the value chain**
2. **Identify relevant technologies** in other industries or under scientific development
3. **Consider development path of technologies** - Determine the likely path of change
4. **Determine which technologies are most competitive** - For sustaining competitive advantage
5. **Assess the firm's current technologies** - Relative capabilities in important technologies
6. **Select a technology strategy** - Encompassing all important technologies that reinforces overall competitive strategy
7. **Reinforce technology strategies at corporate level** - Business unit technology strategies should be reinforced

### Drejer's Four Major Tasks of Technology Managers
1. R&D management
2. Innovation management
3. Technology planning
4. Strategic management of technology

### Strategic Fit (Porter)

> "The self-consistency of a strategic plan can only be assured if all aspects mesh to support and drive one another."

- **Operational effectiveness:** Performing excellence in individual activities
- **Strategic fit:** Enhances uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs of technologies, processes, and the organization

#### Three Types of Strategic Fit:
1. **First order:** Simple consistency between activities and overall strategy
2. **Second order:** Activities are reinforcing
3. **Third order:** Optimization of effect

### Strategic Position

Two primary reasons organizations strategically position around technology:

#### 1. Cost Leadership
- Organization tries to gain competitive advantage with products/services at low cost
- Achieved through technologies that:
  - Increase production and economy of scale
  - Reduce operating costs through improved production processes

#### 2. Product Differentiation
- Organization tries to gain competitive advantage by having a unique product
- Relies on product reputation
- Production and product technology is key to achieving differentiation

## Freeman & Perez Innovation Framework

### A Taxonomy of Innovations

Freeman and Perez (1988) proposed a taxonomy to categorize the thousands of innovations occurring constantly:

### 1. Incremental Innovations
- Occur continuously in any industry or service activity
- Result of 'learning by doing' and 'learning by using'
- Outcomes of inventions and improvements by engineers and users
- Important for steady growth of productivity
- Combined effect is extremely important even if individual innovations seem small
- Reflected in input-output tables over time by changes in coefficients

### 2. Radical Innovations
- Discontinuous events
- Usually result of deliberate R&D in enterprises and/or university/government laboratories
- Unevenly distributed over sectors and over time
- Examples: Nylon, nuclear power - could not emerge from incremental improvements
- Important as springboard for growth of new markets
- May involve combined product, process, and organizational innovation
- Relatively small aggregate economic impact unless clusters emerge in related industries

### 3. Changes of 'Technology System'
- Far-reaching changes affecting several branches of the economy
- Give rise to entirely new sectors
- Based on combination of:
  - Radical innovations
  - Incremental innovations
  - Organizational and managerial innovations
- Example: Cluster of synthetic materials innovations (petro-chemical, injection moulding, extrusion, machinery innovations) introduced in 1920s-1950s

### 4. Changes in 'Techno-Economic Paradigm' (Technological Revolutions)
- Changes so far-reaching they affect behavior of entire economy
- Carry with them many clusters of radical and incremental innovations
- May eventually embody several new technology systems
- **Key characteristic:** Pervasive effects throughout the economy
- Not only leads to new products, services, systems, and industries
- Also affects directly or indirectly almost every other branch of the economy
- Represents a 'meta-paradigm'

### Key Factor Inputs

Each techno-economic paradigm is associated with a 'key factor' that fulfills these conditions:
1. **Low and rapidly falling relative cost** - Clearly perceived
2. **Apparently almost unlimited availability of supply** over long periods
3. **Clear potential** for use or incorporation in many products and processes

### Kondratiev Long Waves (Table 3.1)

| Wave | Period | Description | Key Factor | Main Industries |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **First** | 1770s-1830s/1840s | Early mechanisation, Industrial revolution | Cotton, Pig iron | Textiles, Textile machinery, Iron-working, Water power, Potteries |
| **Second** | 1830s-1880s/1890s | Victorian prosperity | Coal, Steam power | Steam engines, Railway, Machine tools, Iron/Steel |
| **Third** | 1880s-1930s/1940s | Belle epoque, Great depression | Steel, Electricity | Electrical engineering, Heavy machinery, Heavy chemicals |
| **Fourth** | 1930s-1980s/1990s | Fordist mass production, Golden age, Crisis of structural adjustment | Energy (especially oil) | Automobiles, Consumer durables, Process plant, Synthetic materials, Petrochemicals |
| **Fifth*** | 1980s-1990s to ? | Information and communication | 'Chips' (microelectronics) | Computers, Software, Telecommunications, Robotics, Ceramics, Biotechnology |

*Note: All columns dealing with the 'fifth Kondratiev' are necessarily speculative

### Diffusion of New Techno-Economic Paradigms

A new paradigm emerges in a world still dominated by an old paradigm:
- Demonstrates comparative advantages at first only in one or a few sectors
- Fastest-growing sectors are *not* those which are motive branches of established technological regime
- New paradigm emerges only gradually as a new 'ideal type' of productive organization
- Discloses potential for quantum jump in total factor productivity
- Opens unprecedented range of investment opportunities
- Brings radical shift in engineering and managerial 'common sense'
- Tends to diffuse rapidly as conditions allow

### Characteristics of New Techno-Economic Paradigm
When crystallized, involves:
- New 'best-practice' form of organization at firm and plant level
- New skill profile in the labour force
- New product mix making intensive use of low-cost key factor
- New trends in both radical and incremental innovation
- New pattern in location of investment
- Particular wave of infrastructural investment
- Tendency for new innovator-entrepreneur small firms
- Tendency for large firms to concentrate/diversify in key factor branches
- New pattern of consumption and consumer behaviour
