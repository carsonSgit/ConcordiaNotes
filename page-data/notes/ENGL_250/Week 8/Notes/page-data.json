Players will experience agency when there is a balance between the material and formal constraints. When the actions are motivated by the formal constraints (affordances) via dramatic probability in the plot are commensurate with the material constraints (affordances) made available form the levels of spectacle, pattern, language, and thought, then players will experience agency. An imbalance results in a decrease in agency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Audience Participation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A portion of the audience are collaborative co-authors of the story</li>\n<li>But there is also a more traditional audience for RPG performers in actual play\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity for parasocial engagement</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More like Gay-ble Top RPGs (the \"G\" stands for gay)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The body\n<ul>\n<li>Divide between author/audience/character is very thin TTRPGs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alternity\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity to imagine different material conditions (emphasis on worldbuilding)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Queerness &#x26; Otherness\n<ul>\n<li>What if that thing that makes people hate or misunderstand you is actually a soruce of power?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e260d284-1c25-5b8c-ad60-0b18b3d29da9"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
