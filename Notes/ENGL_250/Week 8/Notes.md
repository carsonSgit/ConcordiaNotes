**Coyote & Crow**

- Written by Native American creators
  - Initial goal of raising $18k, ended up raising $1m+

**Why Coyote & Crow**:

- Vivid interest in politics and worldbuilding
- Weaves storytelling into the core rules
- Dense politics in setting
  - Aware of historical materialism
- Rules heavy, but not overwhelming
- Limited character growth opportunities
  - Therefore good for a one-shot
  - Also may inspire interests in playing other sessions

**Cultural Appropriation** KEYWORD:

- What C. Thi Nguyen and Matthew Stohl call "a breach in intimacy"
  - Groups have identification practices they may choose to share with others on a basis of trust
  - Vilating or presuming that trust is appropriation
- James Young & Susan Haley refer to the assimilationist nature 
- Appropriate is taking without giving
  - Is playing C&C appropriate as a non Indigenous person
    - No, we are appreciting

### RPGs:

**DND**: 

- 1974 DnD
  - Rooted in wargamming (going back to 1880)
- 1977 ADnD

- 2000 DnD 3e
  - First after purhcase by Wiazards of the Coast beginning of the Open Game License (OLG) 
  
**Affordances** KEYWORD:

- A term from videogame studies
  - Formal affordances = action required by the plot
  - Material affordances = actions available to playrs
- In RPGS, affordances are socially agreed upon by the Players
- "We are now ready to propose a prescriptive structural model for agency. Players will experience agency when there is a balance between the material and formal constraints. When the actions are motivated by the formal constraints (affordances) via dramatic probability in the plot are commensurate with the material constraints (affordances) made available form the levels of spectacle, pattern, language, and thought, then players will experience agency. An imbalance results in a decrease in agency.
  
**Audience Participation**:

- A portion of the audience are collaborative co-authors of the story
- But there is also a more traditional audience for RPG performers in actual play
  - Opportunity for parasocial engagement

**More like Gay-ble Top RPGs (the "G" stands for gay)**:

- The body
  - Divide between author/audience/character is very thin TTRPGs
- Alternity
  - Opportunity to imagine different material conditions (emphasis on worldbuilding)
- Queerness & Otherness
  - What if that thing that makes people hate or misunderstand you is actually a soruce of power?
