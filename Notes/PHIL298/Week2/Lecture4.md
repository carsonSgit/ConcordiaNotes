# Life Satisfaction

**The Life Satisfaction Account (LSA):**

*The Account:*

Happiness is being satisfied with your life, which amounts to judging or evaluating that your life is going well overall

*Advantages:*

- Makes sense of the connection between happiness and values
- Explains the *holistic* nature of happiness

Directly contrasts **Hedonism**, for example, the misery and pain from training hard for a goal is seen as *worth it* and *satisfying* when we accomplish our goals.

**The problem of cognitive - affective divergence:**

*The Problem:*

1. If LSA is correct, someone is happy if and only if they are satisfied with their life
2. There are people (a) who are satisfied with their lives but don't seem happy and (b) who seem happy but aren't satisfed with their lives
3. Therefore, it's doubtful that LSA is correct

**Defense of Premise 2:**

- Example (a): the *tortured poet*
- Example (b): the *failed actor* turned *parent*

**The problem of instability:**

1. Empirical studies consistently show that self-reports of life satisfaction are unstable.
2. If self-reports of life satisfaction are unstable, then either (a) most of us lack life satisfaction judgements most of the time or (b) we normally do have such a judgement but it's heavily influenced by trivial contextual factors
3. If (a), the LSA impleis there is usually no fact of the matter about whether / to what extent most of us are happy
4. If (b), then LSA implies that happiness is neither well-grounded nor stable
5. Since happiness seems to be a stable well-grounded condition that most of us are usually in, we have good reason to doubt any account of happiness that implies otherwise
6. Therefore, we have good reason to doubt LSA

The instability comes from the infinitely many variables that may alter/affect one's satisfaction at any moment.


**The problem of reasonable inaccurate judgements:**

*The Problem:*

1. Happiness realiably tracks well-being
2. LSA implies that happiness does not reliably track well-being
3. Therefore, we have a good reason to doubt LSA

*Defense of Premise 2:*

- Life satisfaction judgmenets are guided by ethical norms - it can be reasonable for you to judge that your life is going well for you even though it isn't and vice versa
- Examples: Michael the grateful soldier, Ernesta the ambitious entrepreneur
