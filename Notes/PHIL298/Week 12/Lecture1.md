# Disability & Wellbeing

### Terminology

**Physical disability:**

Bodily conditions such as blindess, deafness, rheumatoid arthritis, and mobility impairments

**Ableism:**

Discrimination and prejudice against people with disabilities

- Negative stereotypes, segragataing disabled students in schools, elevators without braille, wheelchair inacessible buildings

### The Bad VS Mere Difference View

**The Bad Difference View:**

Having a disability is, by itself, something that makes you worse off.

**The Mere Difference View:**

Having a disability makes you nonstandard or different but it does not, by itself, make you worse off.

- Compatible with (a) the wellbeing of disabled people being, on average, lower than non-disabled people and (b) disability involving the lack of an intrinsic good

### The Causation Objection

1. If the mere-difference view is correct, then it would be permissible to cause disability in another.
2. It is not permissible to cause disability in another.
3. Therefore, the mere-difference view is not correct.

### Barnes's Rejection of Premise 1

Just because X is a mere-difference does not entail that it is permissble to cause X.

- It is wrong to unjustifiably interfere with another person's life, especially in substantial ways, without their consent
- It is wrong to carelessly cause substantial pain in another person's life - e.g. transition costs

### Cuasing Disability in Babies

**Disabled Baby Case:**

Cara has a 6-month-old infant, Daisy. Cara values disability and thinks that disability is an important part of human diversity. She also thinks thatincreasing the number of happy, well-adjusted disabled people is important to combating ableism. So Cara has Daisy undergo an innovative pro-disability procedure. Daisy doesn't endure any pain and won't remember it. But as a result, Daisy will be disabled for the rest of her life.

**Barnes's Claim:**

It is consistent to belive that it is wrong for a parent to cause X in her child even when X is a mere difference because generally, it is wrong (even for parents) to drastically alter a child's development.

### Causing Disability in Babies: Objection & Response

**Objection:**

Parents regularly make choices that drastically alter their child's development - e.g. decisions about location, healthcare, education.

**Barnes's Resposne:**

Even so, it may be impermissible for parents to drastically alter *identity determining* traits.
