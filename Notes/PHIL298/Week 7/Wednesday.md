# The Badness of Death

### The Key Question

Apart from the pain that sometimes acacompanies death, and apart from the grief of loved ones - is death *itself* bad for the one who dies? If so, why?

### The Deprivation Account

Death is bad for the one who dies (1) NOT because the state of death itself (nonexistence) is bad but rather (2) because it deprives one of the good things one would have had if one had continued living.

### The Experience Worry

**The Worry**

The deprivation account entails that death is bad for you even though it doesn't affect your experience, but something that doesn't affect your experiences cannot be bad for you.

**Nagel's Response**

Some things *can* be bad for you even though they do not affect your experiences.

- betrayal, being ridiculed behind your back

### The Subject Worry

**The Worry**

On the deprivation account, it is not clear who, exactly, is the subject of the badness of death.

**Nagel's Response**

Things can be good/bad for you that happen outside the boundaries of your lifetime - whether something is bad for you can depend on relational facts about alternative possibilities given your personal history.

- Brain injury case
  - Billy is successful business man, but gets into an accident and becomes dependent on caretakers. All his needs are met and his brain has degraded to a point where he is satisfied with life. He is mentally in the state of a newborn, which wouldn't be bad for a newborn but as Billy had had a full-fledged mental capacity, it is bad becausse Billy can no longe experience what he once was, not that being a newborn is bad.

### The Assymetry Worry

**The Worry**

The deprivation account entails tha tprenatal nonexistence is *not* bad for you while postmortem non-existence is bad for you, but there's no principled way to account for this assymetry.

**Nagel's Response**

There IS a principled account of this assymetry - death deprives you of all the goodness of continuing to live while not having been born earlier deprives you of nothing at all.
