# Notes about Knowledge of Language

language is a knowledge, not an ability. you are not *able* to speak english and french, you have the *knowledge* of what it is to communicate in english or french.

inherently know (knowledge) the rules and structure for formulation of sentences to communicate. not things that are taught, i.e. we do not learn to understand the context of a sentence, we *know* how to interpret it, it is a function of the *mind*.

Page 12 "This is knowledge without grounds, without good reasons or support by reliable procedures in any general or otherwise useful sense of these notions*

it is not that we do not have the ability to understand a sentence that lacks context and information, our formation of knowledge in regards to language simply does not have the capacity of creating something out of nothing (i.e. a sentence with no structure)

our system of knowledge has someway formulated to associate sounds and meanings in certain ways but not in others (i.e. hearing "no" we interpret as *denying*, and not as *accepting*), our knowledge "assisgns structural properties to physical events in certain ways, not others" (Page 12)
