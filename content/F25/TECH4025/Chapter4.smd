### The Big Picture

- We can answer much more interesting questions about variables when we compare distributions for different groups.

### Comparing Groups

- It is always more interesting to compare groups.
- With histograms, note the shapes, centres, and spreads of the two distributions.


### Identifying Outliers

- There are different methods to identifying outliers:
	- We can use the method employed when drawing boxplots. A data point is considered unusual if it plots more than 1.5(IQR) from the top of the box and from the bottom of the box.
	- We can use z-scores as discussed in Chapter 5. Any data point with a z-score greater than the absolute value of 3 is considered unusual.
	- We can use formal statistical tests such as the Q-test (also known as the Dixon's test) but that will not be coverred in this course.
	

### Timeplots: Order, Please!

- For some data sets, we are interested in how the data behaves overtime.
- In these cases, we construct **timeplots** of the data.
- A display of values against time is called a time series plot or simply time plot.


### Smoothing Timeplots

- Timeplots often show a great deal of point-to-point variation which can be hard to interpret.
- We can use smoothing techniques to discover underlying trends and then think about how the values vary around that trend.
- This technique will not be coverred in this course.


### Transforming Skewed Data to Improve Symmetry

- Sometimes, we will have a distribution that seems to have outliers, but it may also just have a long tail in a direction.
- There are many ways to make a skewed distribution more symmetric:
	- Re-express
	- Transform
- These can be done by applying a simple function.
	- One of the most common transformations used is the logarithmic function.
	- We can use natural log (Ln) or log base 10 (Log).

### What can go wrong?

- Avoid inconsistent scales, either within the display or when comparing two displays.
- Label clearly so a reader knows what the plot displays.
- Beware of outliers.
- Be careful when comparing groups that have very different spreads.


### What Have We Learned?

- Choose the right tool for comparing distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Treat outliers with attention and care.
- Timeplots - values over time.
- Re-express data to make it easier to work with - make skewed distributions more nearly symmetric.
