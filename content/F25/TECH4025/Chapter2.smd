### Three Rules of Data Analysis

1. Make a picture - **Think:** information may be presented that is not obvious through the raw data, need to *think*.
2. Make a picture - **Show:** important features/patterns in data will *show* up, you may see things that you did not expect.
3. Make a picture - **Tell:** best way to *tell* others about your data is through a graphic.

### Categorical Data

- **Class:** one of the categories in which qualitative (categorical) data can be classified.
- **Class frequency:** number of items in each class.
- **Class relative frequency:** proportion of total items in each class.

### Relative Frequency

**Class Relative Frequency** => (Class frequency)/(Total number of items)  
**Class Percentage** => (Class relative frequency) * 100

### Frequency Tables: Making Piles

**Pile** => pile data by counting # of data values in each category.

1. These **counts** can be put into a *frequency table* which records totals & category names.

```
> Frequency table of Titanic Passengers and crew  
>  ________________  
> | Class  | Count |  
> |--------|-------|  
> | First  |  325  |  
> | Second |  285  |  
> | Third  |  706  |  
> | Crew   |  885  |  
> | Total  |  2201 |  
>  ----------------  
```

2. A **relative frequency table** is similar but gives proportion/percentages (instead of counts) for each category.

```
> Relative Frequency Table:  
>  _______________________________________________________________________  
> | Class   | Count   | Relative Frequency   | Percent Relative Frequency |  
> |---------|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|  
> | First   | 325     | 325/2201 = 0.1477    | 14.77%                     |  
> | Second  | 285     | 285/2201 = 0.1295    | 12.95%                     |  
> | Third   | 706     | 706/2201 = 0.3208    | 32.08%                     |  
> | Crew    | 885     | 885/2201 = 0.4021    | 40.21%                     |  
> | Total   | 2201    | 2201/2201 = 1.00     | 100%                       |  
>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### The Area Principle

The area occupied by part of the graph should correspond to the magnitude of the value it represents.

### Bar Charts

**Bar Charts:**

- **Bar chart** displays the distribution of a categorical variable, showing counts for each category side-by-side for easy comparison.
- Stays true to the *area principle*.

**Relative Frequency Bar Charts:**

- **Relative Frequency bar charts** display the relative *proportion* of counts for each category.
- Stays true to the *area principle*.

### Pie Charts

- Displays the entire group of cases.
- Stays true to the *area principle*.

### Exploring relationships between two categorical variables: Contingency Tables

- A **contingency table** allows for analysis of **two** categorical variables together.
- Shows how individuals are distributed for each variable, contingent on the value of the other variable.

```
> Contingency Table  
>						 Class  
>          _______________________________________  
>  _______| First | Second | Third | Crew | Total |  
> | Alive | 203   | 118    | 178   | 212  | 711   |  
> | Dead  | 122   | 167    | 528   | 673  | 1490  |  
> | Total | 325   | 285    | 706   | 885  | 2201  |  
>  -----------------------------------------------  
```

- Each **cell** gives the count for a combination of the two values.
- The margins (right and on bottom) give totals for each of the variables and can be used to calculate **marginal distribution** for each variable as a proportion/percentage of the total count.
- Using the overall total, calculate the **joint distribution** (combines both the row and column variables)

### Marginal Distribution (by % of "All" counts)

**Totals of each Survival Status:**

- % survivors = (711/2201) * 100 = 32.3%
- % perished = (1490/2201) * 100 = 67.7%

```
> Marginal Distribution (Row variable)  
>  _________________________________________________  
> | Survival | First | Second | Third | Crew | All  |  
> |----------|-------|--------|-------|------|------|  
> | Alive    |       |        |       |      | 32.3 |  
> | Dead     |       |        |       |      | 67.7 |  
> | All      |       |        |       |      | 100  |  
>  -------------------------------------------------  
> Of **all the people** on board the Titanic, **32.3%** survived and **67.7%** perished.
```

**Totals of each Class:**

- % 1st class = (325/2201) * 100 = 14.77%
- % 2nd class = (285/2201) * 100 = 12.95%
- % 3rd class = (706/2201) * 100 = 32.08%
- % crew = (885/2201) * 100 = 40.21%

```
> Marginal Distribution (Column variable)  
>  _________________________________________________  
> | Survival | First | Second | Third | Crew  | All |  
> |----------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----|  
> | Alive    |       |        |       |       |     |  
> | Dead     |       |        |       |       |     |  
> | All      | 14.77 | 12.95  | 32.08 | 40.21 | 100 |  
>  -------------------------------------------------  
```

### Joint Distribution (By % of total)

- Counts in **each** cell are divided by total people (2201).

- **Alive:**
	- 1st class: 9.22%
	- 2nd class: 5.36%
	- 3rd class: 8.09%
	- Crew: 9.63%

- **Dead:**
	- 1st class: 5.54%
	- 2nd class: 7.59%
	- 3rd class: 23.99%
	- Crew: 30.58%

```
> Joint Distribution  
>  _________________________________________________  
> |              Class (Percentages)                |  
> |_________________________________________________|  
> | Survival | First | Second | Third | Crew  | All |  
> |----------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----|  
> | Alive    | 9.22  | 5.36   | 8.09  | 9.63  |     |  
> | Dead     | 5.54  | 7.59   | 23.99 | 30.58 |     |  
> | All      |       |        |       |       |     |  
>  -------------------------------------------------  
```

### Marginal and Joint Distribution

```
> Marginal **and** Joint Distribution  
>  __________________________________________________  
> |              Class (Percentages)                 |  
> |__________________________________________________|  
> | Survival | First | Second | Third | Crew  | All  |  
> |----------|-------|--------|-------|-------|------|  
> | Alive    | 9.22  | 5.36   | 8.09  | 9.63  | 32.3 |  
> | Dead     | 5.54  | 7.59   | 23.99 | 30.58 | 66.7 |  
> | All      | 14.77 | 12.95  | 32.08 | 40.21 | 100  |  
>  --------------------------------------------------
```

### Conditional Distributions

A **conditional distribution** shows the distribution of **one variable** for *individuals who satisfy some condition* on another variable.

```
> Conditional Distribution  
>
> 		            Class  
>          ________________________________________  
>         | First | Second | Third | Crew  | Total |  
>  _______|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|  
> | Alive | 203   | 118    | 178   | 212   | 711   |  
> |       | 28.6% | 16.6%  | 25.0% | 29.8% | 100%  |  
>  ------------------------------------------------  
```

### Percentage Distribution of Survival Status conditional on Class

```
>  ___________________________________________________  
> |     Survival Status Conditional on Class          |  
> |___________________________________________________|  
> | Survival | First | Second | Third | Crew  | All   |  
> |----------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|  
> | Alive    | 62.46 | 41.40  | 25.21 | 23.95 | 32.30 |  
> | Dead     | 37.54 | 58.60  | 74.79 | 76.05 | 66.70 |  
> | All      | 100   | 100    | 100   | 100   | 100   |  
> |---------------------------------------------------| 
> | Cell Contents: % of Column                        |  
>  ---------------------------------------------------
```

### Graphing Conditional Distributions

- Conditional distributions show that there's a difference in survival rate between classes.
- To graph them, use **segmented bar charts** or **side-by-side bar charts**.

### Segmented Bar Charts

- A **segmented bar chart** displays the same info as a pie chart but in bar form.

### Side-by-side bar charts

- Two approaches:
	- **Percent of Survival Status within Class:** two bars per class → Alive & Dead.
	- **Percent of class within Survival Status:** four bars per survival status → First, Second, Third, Crew.

**Analysis:**

- **Chance of survival depended on class.**
- Thus, *Class* and *Survival* are **associated**, they are **not independent**.

> Variables are **independent** if the distribution of one variable in a contingency table is roughly the same for all categories of the other variable.

## Closing Notes

- Can summarize *categorical data* by counts or percentages.
- Can display using bar or pie charts.
- For two-way tables (**contingency tables**), analyze **marginal**, **joint**, or **conditional** distributions.
- If conditional distributions are the same across categories, variables are **independent**.
