## Lesson 3: Project Charter

### Project Initiation Process Group

- The first stage in the project lifecycle.
- The main goal is to officially authorize a project to start by gaining approval from organizational management.
- A key component to this process is creating a **Project Charter**

**Inputs of the Project Initiation Process Group:**

- **Business Documents:** Includes the business case, benefits management plan, or similar documents that justify the project.
- **Agreements:** Contracts or legal agreements that trigger the project need.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** Organizational culture, processes, policies, and external factors influencing project initiation.
- **Organizational Process Assets:** Previous project charters, templates, or historical information.

**Outputs of the Project Initiation Process Group:**

- **Project Charter:** A concise authorization document that has key authorization and project definition elements.

### What is a Project Charter?

The Project Charter is the key document that authorizes the project and empowers the project manager. It is *not* a detailed plan, but a high-level concise document that provides direction and legitimacy.

> A description of what is wanted and measures of success

**Key Elements of the Project Charter contains:**

1. **Project Title and Description:** Clear identification and overview of what the project is about.
2. **Project Manager Assigned and Authority Level:** Who is managing the project, what power they have.
3. **Project Justification or Business Case:** Why the project needs to be done.
5. **Stakeholders:** The individuals or groups with interest or influence in the project.
6. **High-Level Known Project Requirements:** Broad requirements identified early on.
7. **Project Deliverables:** Expected outcomes or products from the project.
8. **Project Constraints and Assumptions:** Known limitations and assumptions impacting the project.
9. **Signature Block:** Approval by key stakeholders or sponsors.

Crucial to successful project initiation.
