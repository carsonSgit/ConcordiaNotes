Partnering for mutual benefit is essential for total quality in a competitive marketplace.

Working together for mutual benefit is a practical approach for business.

### Partnering or Strategic Alliances

- The concept of Partnering or Strategic Alliances involves working together for mutual benefit
- Partnerships can be established amongst various participants:
	- Suppliers
	- Customers
	- Employees
	- Potential Competitors
- Partnering can lead to continuous improvements in areas such as:
	- Processes and products
	- Relationships between customers and suppliers
	- Customer satisfaction
- Internal partnering can improve relations between employees and departments within an organization
- Maximum benefits of partnering are achieved when all parties cooperate in the chain of partners

### Innovative Alliances and Partnerships

Many innovative partnerships exist in today's highly innovative competitive marketplace, such as Coca Cola and Nestle's research partnership.

No limits on how many and what type of alliances and partnerships can be formed by a company.

### Internal Partnering

An organization must focus on internal partnering to fully realize the potential of it's workforce and achieve continuous quality improvement.

This involves forming partnerships at 3 levels:

- Between Management and Employees
- Between Teams
- Between Employees

Concept that involves creating a supporting environment that has mechanisms to foster connection between individuals to maximize human resources.

This approach is much more beneficial than a Internal Competition strategy. 

### Partnering with Suppliers

- Includes promoting continuous improvement of quality, productivity, and competitiveness
- Not all suppliers can participate in such relationships and they should be required to qualify to participate
	- Qualifying a supplier shows that they can guarantee the delivery of defect free products in specified quantities when and where they are needed
- The level of commitment and synergy that develops between a buyer and supplier personnel determines whether a supplier becomes a partner

**Mandatory requirements of supplier partnerships:**
- Commitment
- Continual Nurturing
- To achieve this, supplier personnel should meet with personel beyong those in the purchasing office (ideally those who *use* their products)
- Negotiation should not be based just on price, but should also take product features, quality, and delivery concerns into concern
- The suppliers' quality processes should guarantee the quality of suppliers products
- Just-in-time (JIT) should be fully understood and in practice
	- Buyers should be able to practice JIT to avoid maintaining inventory
- Both partners should be capable of sharing information electronically by using business solutions (ERPs, MRPs)

### Stages of Development in Supplier Partnerships

4. Adoption of New Paradigms
	- Approaching mutual benefit
5. Awareness of Potential
	- Both partners become fully aware of possible benefits from their partnership
6. Adoption of New Values
	- Both partners adopt the new values inherent in a true supplier-buyer partnership
7. Mature Partnering
	- Partnership has solidified and a high level of trust/cooperation has been established between partners
	
### Managing Quality in the Supply Chain


> Modern aircraft and many other major manufactured products are composed of parts from different suppliers.
> This creates a need to manage quality in the supply chain (quality of final product is only as good as quality of it's suppliers).
> In the current world, suppliers can be found all over the world making it hard to find a quality supplier.

**Organizations adopt approaches such as:**

- Supplier evaluations
	- Graded on criteria such as: Quality, On-time delivery, technical capabilities, process capabilities, and management quality
- Certifications
	- More involved
	- Imply long-term relations
- Third party filters
	- ISO
	- Registers or certifies suppliers
- Supplier Audits
	- Audits on Suppliers
- Supplier Development programs
	- Provide mentoring and training to suppliers that show promise/have unique/rare/hard-to-get products

### Partnering with Potential Competitors

Many organizations use it to enhance competitiveness & improve market positions.

**Joint Activities of U.S. Manufacturing Networks:**

- **Production**
	- SMEs can take on larger production contracts by forming teams within networks
- **Education and Training**
	- SMEs have limited resources and access, so they face challenges in providing ongoing education and training to employees
	- By partnering with other SMEs, they can solve these problems through economies of scale (more SMEs seeking education, bulk deal/discounts on education costs)
- **Marketing**
	- Promote combined capabilities
	- Costs for Trade Show participation as an example
- **Product Development**
	- Developing new products can be too expensive for SMEs, but can be divided amongst network members
- **Technology Transfer**
	- Movement of technology from one arena to another
	- Proper use of technology requires knowledge sharing, which networks use to promote effective technology transfer
- **Purchasing**
