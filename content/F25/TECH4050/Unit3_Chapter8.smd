### Employee Empowerment Defined

In a Total Quality setting, employee involvement and empowerment are distinct concepts

Example provided, a CEO involved employees by soliciting employees through suggestion boxes but *did* not empower employees to submit suggestions. This led to a decline in employee suggestions and morale, with *no* improvement in productivity.

The difference between involvement and empowerment is ownership. Involved employees provide input but lack ownership, in contrast, an empowered employee takes ownership over their work leading to a sense of pride, urgency for improvement, and a focus on quality.

**How Employee Empowerment is Achieved:**
- Textbook mentions outdated management philosophy -> Managers think, employees work
	- Emphasizes the importance of empowering employees in the workplace
	- Highlights the need for a supportive and open environment that encourages employee involvement, recognizes employee value, and rewards process ownership

**Management Tool or Cultural Change:**
- The importance of considering empowerment as more than just another management tool and addressing employee skepticism
- It is important to understand the need for a shift in corporate culture and a change in the division of labour between managers and workers for the successful implementation of empowerment strategies

**Empowerement does not mean Abdication:**
- Empowermenet in the workplace emphasizes that it is not about relinquishing control but rather about involving employees in decision making processes
- The text argues that empowerement enhances managers power by ensuring comprehensive and accurate information for decision making, allowing managers to focus on larger decisions leading to better outcomes.


### Rationale for Empowerment

- Actively involve and empower employees to harness creativity and independent thinking to generate superiour ideas, make informed decisions and enhance productivity
- Empowering employees is equally as essential as technological advancement in regards of fostering competitiveness


**Empowerment & Motivation:**
- Encourage to share opinions, crucial part of effective management
	- Demonstrates that their insights are highly valued
- Participatory management involved managers and supervisors seeking their employee's assistance, whereas empowerment entails fostering an environment where employees are encouraged to take initiative and support one another (as well as the company)
	- Can boost employee motivation (ownership)
	- Makes employees more inclined to take calculated risks & make decisions
	

### Inhibitors of Empowerment

- Resistance to change from Employees and Unions
	- Can lead to resistance to change
	- Unions may be resistant to empowerment initiatives due to concerns about their future & relationship with management
- Resistance from Management
	- Success requires solid commitment from management
	- Employees take cues from management, without strong support empowerment efforts may fail
	- Lack of commitment from management can lead to the loss of valuable programs and hinder companies ability to compete
	- Management resistance to empowerment may stem from factors such as:
		- Insecurity
		- Personal Values
		- Ego
		- Inadequate training
		- Exclusion of management
	- Fear of Losing Control
	- I'm-the-boss-syndrome
	- Status (manager's status)
	- Outdated management training
	- Old-school syndrome
	- Fear of exclusion
- Workforce Readiness
	- Employee readiness is crucial for empowermenet
	- Important to assess whether the workforce is prepared for empowerment
		- One way to gauge is to consider the level of education 
			- well-educated employees are generally more ready for empowermeent as they are used to critical thinking and decision making
			- does not mean that less educated employees should be excluded, they may just need additional preparation
	- To determine readiness to empowerment, consider the following questions:
		- Are the employees accustomed to critical thinking
		- Are they knowledgeable of the decision making process and their role in regards to it
		- Are the emplyoees fully formed in regards to the big picture and where they fit into it
		- **If the answer to any of these questions is NO, the workforce may not be ready for empowerment**
- Organizational Structure and Management Practices
	- Empowerment implementation can be resistant due to attitudes organizational structure, and management practices within a company
	- Before trying to implement empowerment, its important to consider the following:
		- How many layers of management are there between workers and decision makers
		- Does the employee perofrmance appraisal system encourage or discourage initiative and risk taking
		- Do management practices encourage employees to speak out against policies and procedures that inhibit quality and productivity
