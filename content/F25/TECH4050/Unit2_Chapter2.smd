### The Relationship Between Quality and Competitiveness

To stay competitive, businesses must produce high quality goods and services.

Total quality commitment leads to better working conditions, less stress, and more opportunities for advancemenet, leading to better job satisfaction.

Financial rewards and positive interpersonal relations between employees and supervisors are more likely to occur in competitive organizations.

### Cost of Poor Quality

Can hurt a companies' ability to compete globally.

Organizations must work to reduce costs associated with poor quality and maintain essential services, product features, and personel.

This calls for identifying areas for improvement that yield the highest return.

**Traditional Costs:**

- Waste
- Rejects
- Testing
- Rework
- Customer returns
- Inspection
- Recalls

**Hidden Costs:**

- Excess overtime
- Pricing errors
- Billing errors
- Excess turnover
- Premium freight costs
- Development cost of a failed product
- Field service costs
- Overdue receivables
- Handling complaints
- Expediting
- System costs
- Planning delays
- Late paperwork
- Lack of follow-up
- Excess inventory
- Customer allowances
- Unused capacity

### Competitiveness and the U.S. Economy

After WW2, US was the only major industrialized nation with an intact manufacturing sector, resulting in a period of prosperity.

Other nations realized they needed to produce world-class goods at competitive pricess.

American manufacturers were slow to catch up and continued to produce waste.

> - Many of higher paying manufacturing jobs are being exported to foreign countries
> - Number of people having to work at more than one job to maintain their quality of life has increased continually since the 1960s
> - Most financially rewarding work years have historically been between ages 40 and 50. In te 1950s, people in this age bracket experienced a 36% increase in real income. By 2008, their ocunterparts had experienced a decline in real income and the trend continues
> - The gap between the haves and have-nots is growing

### Factors Inhibitors of Competitiveness

Improving National Competitiveness is a challenging task that can't be done solely following Total Quality approach.

While individual companies *can* benefit from TQM, you need more for a national level competition.

**Factors that inhibit competitiveness:**

- Socioeconomic
- Sociopolitical

They fall into three categories:

- Business and Government Related
	- Short-term profit focus
	- Excessive medical costs
	- Costs of liability inflated by lawyers on contingency fees
- Family Related
	- Lack of Educational Value
	- Single parent (impact on child motivation)
- Education Related
	- Student performance in the USA has not kept pace with the global marketplace

### Comparison on International Competitors

- Standard of Living
- Manufacturing Productivity
- Investment
- Trade

Despite poor performance of USA students compared to other nations, USA has made critical progress in their competitive factors that reinforces their position at the top of the global market.


### Human Resources and Competitiveness

- Cooperation Among Business, Labour, and Government
- High-Quality Education and Training
- Employee Involvement and Empowerment
- Leadership at All Levels
- Teamwork

> After WW2, Germany and Japan were low on a specific resource: People. 
> They put a focus on Human Resources methodologies to bolster their competitive approach.

### Characteristics of World-Class Organizations

The **American Management Association (AMA)** conducted a global survey to determine the key areas of concern for organizations competing in the global marketplace.

The survey revealed that organizations should focus on 15 areas to compete globally.

**To Compete in the Global Marketplace:**

1. Customer Service
2. Quality Control and Assurance
3. Research and development/new product development
4. Acquiring new technologies
5. Innovation
6. Team-based approach (adopting and using effectively)
7. Best practices (study and use of)
8. Manpower planning
9. Environmentally sound practices
10. Business partnerships and alliances
11. Reengineering of processes
12. Mergers and acquisitions
13. Outsourcing and contracting
14. Reliance on consulting services
15. Political lobbying

**Other Human Resource topics:**

1. Worker productivity (improvement)
2. Employee training and development
3. Open communication between management and employees
4. Employee benefits and prerequisites
5. Codes of workplace conduct
6. Conflict resolution
7. Employee satisfaction
8. Flextime arrangements
9. Management-employee-union relations
10. Child care

### World-Class Manufacturing: What it takes

Manufacturers use various strategies such as competitive analysis, quality tips, production and supply chain, customization, and ecommerce, to stay ahead of competition by focusing on *customer needs*.

Manufacturers must **meet and exceed benchmarks** to compete in the global marketplace.

- On-time delivery of products that meet specification (98% or better)
- Productivity improvements over the last 3 years (improvements in all applicable areas)
- Investment in capital equipment as a percentage of sales on a 3-year average (10% minimum)
- Achieving annual sales from products introduced in the last 3-years (50% minimum)
- Investing in new product develpoment as a percent of sales (10% minimum)

### Management-by-Accounting: Antithesis of Total Quality

When an organization's financial performance is prioritized over managing the factors that most effect financial performance (such as people, processes, and quality).

This approach leads to short-term thinking and decision making, where companies focus on cost-cutting rather than investing in continuous improvement to remain competitive in the long run.

The textbook argues that more quality professionals need to put themselves on the CEO track, and that all business related degrees should include a more thorough study of quality to avoid falling into the Management-by-Accounting trap.

### U.S. Companies: Global Strengths and Weaknesses

**To compete in global markets, a country should have:**

1. An economy open to foreign investment and trade
2. Government that minimizes controls on business but does a good job of supervising financial institutions
3. A judicial system that works well and helps reduce corruption
4. Greater transparency and availability of economic information
5. High labour mobility
6. Ease of entry by new businesses

The United States is a global leader due to it's entrepreneurial spirit, advanced technologies, low taxes, low unionization, and world-class higher education.
The country has a low tax burden, less union activity, and top tier colleges/universities with readily available financial aid.

There are also some global disadvantages of U.S. companies, such as:

- Increasing gov regulation
- Growing underclass of have-nots
- Weak public school system (K-12)
- Poorly skilled labour force with poor training opportunities
- Increasing protectionist sentiment to restrict imports
- Growing public alienation with large institutions (public and private)

The challenge is to balance protecting national interests and enabling businesses to compete globally.

The U.S. public education system needs higher quality or the post-secondary education's quality will diminish.

### Quality Management Practices in Asian Countries

Japan, South Korea, and China, have adopted Quality Management practices to compete effectively globally.

Other asian countries (Bangladesh, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand), have followed lead and adopted Total Quality techniques.

The adoption of ISO standards and National Quality awards has further enhanced the quality practices of asian countries.

As a result, companies in the United States have found themselves battling daily against companies from all over Asia.
