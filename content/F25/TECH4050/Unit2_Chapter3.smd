### Strategic Planning Overview

Process that involves developing the vision, mission, guiding principles, broad objectives, and specific strategies for achieving the objectives.

**Step 1:** Develop the Vision
**Step 2:** SWOT Analysis (Environmental Assessment) to identify strenghts, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
**Step 3:** Develop the Mission
**Step 4:** Develop the Guiding Principles
**Step 5:** Develop the Broad Strategic Objectives
**Step 6:** Develop the Specific Tactics (Action Plan)

**Creative Thinking in Strategic planning:**

- Organizations must think creatively to develop strategic plans to help them stay competitive
- Often organizations stick to the same processes year after year which can hinder growth and make it difficult to provide superior value
- In his book "Sacred Cows make the Best Burgers", Robert Cregle, it's said that organizations should identify and eliminate costly sacred cows that are no longer useful
	- It's essential to challenge existing approaches, break the ice by sharing stories, and encourage all participants to suggest ideas without fear of criticism
- It's crucial to allow enough time for ideas to germinate and to avoid rushing the planning process


**SWOT Analysis:**

- Before developing a strategic plan, it is essential to conduct a SWOT Analysis to determine the organizations internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats.
- Strenghts could include: 
	- Finanical stability
	- Good reputation
	- High quality prod
	- Costs leadership
	- Efficient technological processes
	- Talented Workforce
- Weaknesses could include:
	- Weak management teams
	- Obsolete facilities
	- Poorly defined operating procedures
	- Weak distribution systems
	- High unit costs
- External opportunities:
	- Availability of new customers
	- Expanding markets
	- New online technologies
- External threats:
	- Lower cost competitors
	- Higher quality competitors
	- Change in consumer preferences
	- Potentially damaging demographic changes
	

**Vision Development:**

- An organization's vision is it's driving force and defines it's reason for being
- A well written vision statement should be easily understood, clear, comprehensive, and challenging yet attainable
- Should be capable of exciting stakeholders and creating unity of purpose
- The tone of the vision should set the direction of the employees to achieve the organization's goals
- Vision statements should not concern themselves with numbers as they are left for the strategic planning process
	
**Mission Development:**

- Describe the organization:
	- Who (organization and it's customers)
	- What
	- Where
- Brief, simple, easy to understand

**Guiding Principles Development:**

- Set's the companies values as it works towards it's mission
- Forms the foundation of corporate culture
	- Freedom through control -> innovate within boundaries
- Establish parameters between which the mission can be pursued
- May include:
	- Ethics
	- Quality
	- Customer Satisfaction
	- Stakeholder partnerships
	- Employee input
	- Continual improvement
	- Safe and healthy work environment
	- Consistent peak performance
	- Corporate citizenship
	- Environmental protection
- Executive managers are responsible for developing guiding principles *but* input from all levels is recommended


### Broad Strategic Objectives Development

> The measurable targets that organizations aim to achieve to realize their vision and mission.
>
> More specific than the mission but still broad in nature, defines what the organization must do to achieve it's vision without going into the specifics of how to accomplish it.
> 
> Well-written and broad organizational objectives are stated in a way that don't require constant re-writting yet specific enough to measurable without using numbers.
>
> Each objective is focused on a single issue or desired outcome and is tied directly to the organizations vision and mission.
> 
> Follows the organizations Guiding Principles and clearly show what the organization wants to accomplish.
>
> Applies to the organization, not individual departments.
> 
> To have a sustainable competitive advantage, broad strategic objectives should be written in a specific way.

**Five Steps for Writing Broad Strategic Objectives:**

1. Mission should be circulated throughout the organization, input should be gathered from all stakeholders asking what needs to be accomplished to fulfill the mission
2. Analyze input to determine the Optimum Input that best supports the organization's vision and mission
3. Any differences should be discussed in greater depth allowing time for participants to resolve their differences
4. The final objectives can be selected once differences have been resolved
5. Publicizing organization's objectives so that all stakeholders know what they are and can play their respective roles in accomplishing them

> In short:
> 1. Assemble Input
> 2. Find Optimum Input
> 3. Resolve Differences
> 4. Finalize Objectives
> 5. Publish Objectives

**Cautions Concerning Broad Strategic Objectives:**

- Keep them few in number (5-8 ideally)
- Keep the language simple and easily understood by all employees
- Tie them to the mission and vision
- Should not limit or restrict performance, and should not include numerical targets
- Make them a means to an end not an end themselves
- Do not use them in the employee appraisal process
- Relate them to all employees
- Make them challenging but not impossible


**Development of Specific Tactics: Action Plan**

- An action plan is a set of specific tactics to achive an organizations strategic objectives.
- Must be:
	- specific
	- measurable
	- quantifiable
	- timebound
	- assignable
	- directly tied to the objective

**Individual Tactics Drafting**

Begin with broad strategic objectives. 

**Tactics Development Form** is a tool that can help in developing tactics.

- Evaluated based on: specificity, measurability, achievability criteria
- To write well structured tactics: 
	- What specific activities are required to achieve the objective
	- Who should be responsible for each activity
	- When much each activity be completed?

> Example Tactics Develpoment Form
>
>		**Tactic**				      **Responsible Individual / Unit**		**Time Frame/Deadline**
>
>	1. Arrange TQ training for all					CEO						Completed by January 15
>		executive managers.							
>
>	2. Arrange teamwork training for				CEO						Completed by January 30
>		all executive managers.
>
>	3. Give all employees training			Department Managers				January 15-February 20
>		in the use of problem-solving/
>		quality tools.
>
>	4. Give all employees training in		Department Managers				March 15-May 15
>		continual improvement methods.
>
>	5. Establish a company-supported	Human Resources Department			In place by February 28
>		off-duty education program
>		for all employees

### Executing the Strategic Plan

- Organizations often make detailed and comprehensive plans, but these plans fail shortly after execution.
- This is why execution is a crucial part of strategic management that deserves as much attention as planning.
- Even the best plan is useless without an effective execution.

**Critical steps in Strategic Execution planning:**

- Communicating
- Building capabilities
- Establishing Strategy support of stimuli
- Eliminating administrative barriers
- Identifying advocates and resistors
- Exercising strategic leadership
- Being flexible and improvising
- Monitoring and adjusting as needed

The plan should be considered flexible guidelines rather than rigid roadmaps, managers should be open to improvising if circumstances change or the assumptions are innacurate.
