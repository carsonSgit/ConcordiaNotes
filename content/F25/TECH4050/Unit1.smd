## Total Quality Pioneers

### Deming

> Responsible for the Total Quality approach & pioneered use of statistics in quality (embraced by Japanese Industrialists after WW2, by 1980s he was embraced by USA)
- The Deming Cycle
	1. Plan
	2. Do
	3. Check
	4. Act
	5. Analyze
- Deming's Fourteen Points
	1. Create constancy of purpose toward the improvement of products and services in order to become competitive, stay in business, and provide jobs
	2. Adopt the new philosophy. Management must learn that it is a new economic age and awaken to the challenge, learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change
	3. Stop depending on inspection to achive quality. Build in quality from the start
	4. Stop awarding contracts on the basis of low bids
	5. Improve continuously and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly reduce costs
	6. Insitute training on the job
	7. Institute leadership. The purpose of leadership should be to help people and technology work better
	8. Drive out fear so that everyone may work effectively
	9. Break down barriers between departments so that people can work as a team
	10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce. They create adversarial relationships
	11. Eliminate quotas and management by objectives. Substitute leadership
	12. Remove barriers that rob employees of their pride of workmanship
	13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement
	14. Make the transformation everyone's job and put everyone to work on it
- Deming's Seven Deadly Diseases
	1. Lack of constancy of purpose to plan products and services that have a market sufficient to keep the company in business and provide jobs
	2. Emphasis on short-term profits; short-term thinking that is driven by a fear of unfriendly takeover attempts and pressure from bankers and shareholders to produce dividends
	3. Personal review systems for managers/management by objectives without providing methods/resources to accomplish objectives. Performance evaluations, merit ratings, and annual appraisals are all part of this disease
	4. Job hopping by managers
	5. Using only visible data and information in decision making with little or no consideration given to what is not known or cannot be known
	6. Excessive medical costs
	7. Excessive costs of liability driven up by lawyers who work on contigency fees
