# Why Indigenous Literatures Matter, “Introduction”

"Indigenous Deficiency" --> The Anti-Indigenous idea that Indigenous people inherently house negative traits (or the lack of positive traits). 

--> Contrastingly is the reality of things, Indigenous peoples are consistently put at disadvantages by the continued effects of colonialism.

Stories can do harm & good. 

Journals and news agencies often diminish the status of Indigenous peoples by using other names such as "native", "aboriginal", "indigenous". This is stated as an act of political diminishment. 

To properly indicate the naming, it must be done with a capital to signify the political standing (i.e. Aboriginal, Indigenous)

A large part of Canadian (and colonialist settlers) history is based on the erasure and dehumanization of Indigenous history.

Negative stereotypes in regards to Indigenous literature perpetuate negativity to those in relation (Indigenous peoples and those who read the literature), though it also disuades potential readers from involving themselves into such literature in order to avoid being seen in a negative light, subsequently continuing the stereotype.

"every time we privilege the literary, we run the
risk of doing violence to the specific relational contexts of the oral.
Reading can be a very isolated and isolating experience; sharing stories orally is done in the context of living, dynamic peoplehood—
one reason why it’s so significant to Indigenous communities, where
so much knowledge is transmitted between living people, not mediated by objects like books"

Indigenous literatures matter as any other form of literature matters. The existence of Indigenous literature combats the erasure and propogation of negativity surrounding the Indigenous populus.
