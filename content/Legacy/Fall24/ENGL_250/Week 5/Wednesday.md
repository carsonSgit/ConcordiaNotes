- Could be 1 person or an ensemble
- Almost never a member of the regular police
    - Also often not even an official detective
- Always an outsider

    - Allows them to pass through anywhere (access to everywhere) but they may not belong anywhere
- The Detective is the master of secrets
- Crime is often shown as a form of deviance
- The focus, focalizer, and the embodiment of what Crime fiction explores

**The Hard-Boiled Detective**

- Marks the shift to *Noir*
- The detective as everyman
    - Usually some guy beaten down by everyday life
    - Contravenes the Platonic Ideal of detectives like Holmes or Poirot
- Not just flawed; often unforgiveable or criminals themselves
    - Emotionally stunted by the machinations around them

**Crime around the Globe**

- Hardboiled detectives are often as much criminals as their antagonists
- Noir fuels the already global momentum of crime fiction throughout the 20th century
