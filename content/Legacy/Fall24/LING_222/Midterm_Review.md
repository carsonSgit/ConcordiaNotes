# Review for the Midterm

> Writing answers to study prompts on the midterm review

1. **I-Language. What does I stand for?**

    - Internal  
        - The I-Language is a part of your mind so to say. It is not something out there in the word, not physical, not theoretical, it is an internal tool.
    - Individual
        - Our I-Languages differ from person to person just as our brains differ. Taking the example of English, my I-Language makes my "understanding" of English differ from yours. 
    - Intentional
        - A rule is used to compute the delivery/recognition of stimuli to deliver a certain method.

2. Jackendoff's three fundamental arguments, what are the claims?

    - Internalism
        - **The argument for mental grammar**
        - Our minds contain knowledge of an abstract system of rules that allows us to generate/compute.
    - Nativism
        - **Argument for innate knowledge**
        - Aspects of our Mental Grammar are not learnt but rather we are born with it. Sometimes called Universal Grammar **(Mental Grammar != Universal Grammar. Mental Grammar = Universal Grammar + Experience)**.
    - Constructivism
        - **Argument for the construction of experience**
        - Our minds construct our experience of the world as it perceives it.

3. "Knowledge of language is..." What are the three characteristics?

    - Abstract
        -  Words, syllables, stresss are not physically definable.
    - Unconscious
        - Speakers of Pintupi are not aware of the Pintupi stress rule.
    - Rule governed
        - stress is *computed* according to explicit rulees that apply to abstract categories like syllables.

4. I-Language != Innate, why?

    > BLANK. I DONT KNOW !

5. Mental Grammar and I-Language? How do they relatee to each other?

6. MG = UG + Experience. What does this mean?

7. Intensional vs. Extensional. What is the difference?

8. Equivalence classes.

9. Extensional equivalence, what are the examples?

10. I- vs. E- vs. P-Language, Socio-political and Normative-teleological notions of language.

11. How do we choose between extensionally equivalent grammars (i) if you are an I-Linguist; (ii) if you are an E-Linguist?

12. Lessons from reduplication.

13. What do the following demonstrate?

    - Visual illusions (triangles, Necker cube, etc.)
    - Class demo from Bregman's Auditory Scene Analysis ("masking effect", African Xylophone music, etc.)
    - Word boundaries (the computer assignment)
    - *The Star-Spangled Banner* songs

14. Finite State Machines/Grammarss. What can they do? What are the limitations?

15. Can FSMs model English? What implications can we draw from the answer to this question?

16. Technical definition of "grammatical"

17. Modelling a human grammar -- generating ALL and ONLY

18. Over- vs. Under-generate

19. What are these examples for?

    - (1a) Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
    - (1b) Furiously sleep ideas green colorless. 
    - (2a) I saw a fragile whale. 
    - (2b) I saw a fragile of. 
    - (4a) The book seems interesting. 
    - (4b) The child seems sleeping. 
    - (5a) John ate an apple. 
    - (5b) John ate. 
    - (5c) John is too tough to eat tofu. 
    - (5d) John is too tough to eat. 
    - (6a) I wonder who the men expected to see them. 
    - (7b) The men expected to see them. 
    - (8a) You are not allowed running here. 
    - (8b) You are not arrowed to run here.

    - **Grammatical != Meaningful**: 1a, 1b, 4a, 4b
    - **Grammatical != Probable**: 2a, 2b,

## Notes

**Internalism**:

- The argument for **Mental Grammar**. The nature of language tells us that our minds contain knowledge of an abstract system of rules that allows us to *generate*, that is, produce and understand language. This type of system is called a *grammar*. The mind is a computational system.

**Nativism**:

- The argument for **innate knowledge**. Some aspects of our Mental Grammar are not learned, but are rather innate (we are born with them). This innate knowledge is sometimes called *Universal Grammar*.

**Constructivism**:

- The argument for the **Construction of Experience**. Our experience of the world is (partially?) dependent upon what our minds bring to perception; we do not experience the physical world directly.

**Internalism and Nativism are Distinct**:

- Mental Grammar = UG + Experience
- **UG** refers to innate aspects of this knowledge
    - Just because you believe that Mental Grammars exist you do not necessarily believe that it is entirely innate.
- **Experience** refers to the exposure that is needed to convert the initial innate state of the language faculty into a differentiated language faculty. Essentially meaning that Experience converts UG into English, Spanish, etc.

**NP**: Noun-Phrase

- Example:
    - Largest lake on an island
    - Largest island in a lake
    - Largest island in a lake on an island in a lake
    - Largest island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island

**Empricism**:

- Theory of knowledge that emphasizes the role of experience in the formation of ideas. Scientific statements are derived from our experiences and observations.

**Positivism**:

- Claims to be a fundamentally non-metaphyisical ("positive") philosophy, modelled on empirical sciences and providing them with a methodology.
- Positivism is empiricism brought to extreme logical consquences: in as much as knowledge is empircal knowledge, no speculation can be knowledge.
- **The only knowledge we can have is based upon experience.**
- Reject theoretical speculation as means of obtaining knowledge.
- Rules:
    - Record only what is manfiested in experience. Rely only upon sense data. Rule out metaphysical or theological bases for verification.
    - No generalized constructs or terms that cannot be reconstructed by reference to sense data.

**E-Language (external)**:

- Language is taken to be a corpus of actual or potential utterances. The grammar is a formal description of this corpus.
- There can be no question of truth---one grammar (description) is as valid as another as they are extensionally equivalent.
- E-Language is consistent with an anti-UG view. Under E-Language, grammars are not properties of individuals, there is no basis for constraining the set of possible languages.
- Implicitly depends on socio-political concept: How do we decide that a corpus is a corpus of a single language?

**P-Language (platonic)**:

- There is a Platonic ideal that exists independent of actual speakers, meaning for P-Language that within P-English for example, there are words that have never been said before.

**I-Language (internalized)**:

- Language as a matter of individualized psychology (more concrete than E/P-Language)

**Extensional Equivalence**:

- Essentially means that several things generate the same output.
    - For example, a stress pattern for one word in Weri is able to be used on all words within the Weri language.
- Useful to help determine the best understanding of Universal Grammar
    - "In other words, evidence from one language’s stress system, say
that of Weri, should bear on the best analysis of those in other
languages, such as Maranungku, since both are forms taken by the
initial state of the human linguistic stress faculty."

**Language**:

- Set of sentences/strings.
- The set can be finite/infinite.

**Grammatical/Ungrammatical**:

- No such thing as an ungrammatical sentence.
- If grammar G generates a string, then that string is a sentence of G.
    - If grammar G does not generate a string, then that string is not a sentence of G.
- "Each grammar is related to the corpus in a manner fixed in advance by a given linguistic theory"
- **Grammatical = Generated by the grammar**.
- **Ungrammatical = not generated by the grammar**.
    - Meaning grammaticality is a relative notion relative to a particular grammar.

**Grammar**: 

- Autonomous.
- Independent of meaning.
- Statistics irrelevant to grammaticality.

**Finite State Machine**:

- Requirement: Grammar must be finite.
- Each sentence has a finite length.
- No memory.
- No *fsg* is sufficient for Language.

**ALL and ONLY**:

- We need to be sure that these grammars (*fsg*'s) generate all and **ONLY** the sentences of the language.
- Why is it trivial to generate **ALL** the sentences in these languages? What *fsg* will do it?

**Overgenerate**:

- Generate ungrammaticals.
