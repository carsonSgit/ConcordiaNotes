# Pleasure by Haybron

### Notes

"happiness consists solely in pleasant states of mind, or pleasantness itself" -> Hedonist view

**Why Hedonism is an invalid depiction of what happiness is**

Hedonism: Happiness comes by virtue of having a sufficiently favourable balance of pleasure versus unpleasure, i.e. Joy comes from pleasure

**Primary issue** of hedonism is that they are too inclusive of an ideology. Passing pleasures supposedly count towards a person's happiness, but such cannot accurately depict how happy a person is. 
    i.e., having a good meal does not mean you are a happy person.

Emotional State theory -> if one's state is positive, one is happy, if one's state is negative, one is unhpapy
    Happiness is not an emotion or mood, but the culmination of one's emotional state

Life satisfaction theory -> Your attitude to life, are you satisfied? Then you are happy

Hedonistic happiness consists of nothing but a series of conscious events -> under Hedonism, someone is happy due to their recent experiences being primarily of a positive nature, ignorant of their past experiences or even concurrent mental state.

Happinesss may be defined as the culmination of ones' mental state that determines what they are predisposed to experiencing. If the culmination of your mental state leans towards irritability, then that is how you will tend to experience your surroundings, under a lens of irritability. If such is under a more joyous lens, then the same would happen unto your life, just under a different lens. 

Thus hedonism cannot accurately be used to describe happiness. The basis of hedonism is in relation to a reward-based system, where doing something that results in pleasure is what makes one happy, but such an idea is flawed, with one reason being that it disregards the state of your mind in relation to such action. If you are mad and then eat a phenomenal sandwich, that sandwich, no matter how amazing, will not all of a sudden make you a happy person.
