# Life Satisfaction

Three arguments against life satisfaction:

1. "Cognitive Affective Divergence" generate serious counter examples to common life satisfaction views
2. Doubt in fact that people have attitudes towards their lives robust and well-grounded enough about their lives to have significance that happiness is said to possess
3. Life satisfaction should be central to well-being reflects a fundamental misundeerstanding about the charactere of such attitudes

Life satisfaction does not rely on happiness, someone can be having a terrible life but still be satisfied.

Life satisfaction: Favourable attitude toward life as a whole

It's hard to get a real understanding of one's life satisfaction as there are many internal factors and biases that may influence their belief regardless of their true satisfaction with their lives (current weather, current mood, current surroundings, etc.)

"life satisfaction attitudes are either too scarce or too poorly grounded and insubstantial to possess anything like the significance happiness is thought to have."
