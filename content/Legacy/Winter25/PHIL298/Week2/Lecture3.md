# Hedonism

### Hedonism about happiness

**The Acccount:**

Happiness is a preponderance of pleasure over pain.

**Implications:**

- Any pleasure makes a positive difference to your level of happiness (no matter how small or fleeting)
- The more intense a pleasurable experience is, the bigger positive impact it has on your level of happiness
- Happiness and pleasure co-vary

### The problem of Irrelevant Pleasures

**The Problem:**

1. If hedonism is correct, then any pleasurable experience positively affects happiness
2. Some pleasures - irrelevant pleasures - do not have any effect on happiness
3. Therefore, hedonism is not the correct view of happiness

**Defense of Premise 2:**

- Superficial pleasures - e.g. eating a cheeseburger, playing monopoly
- Some really intense pleasures - e.g. the pleasures of sex and drugs

Hedonism therefore doesn't fit as a view of happiness.

**The Problem of Reduction:**

1. If there are aspects of happiness besides pleasure that don't reduce to pleasure, then hedonism is not the correct view of happiness
2. There seems to be more to happiness than pleasure - plausibly, a positive emotional state and/or satisfaction with one's life
3. Neither a positive emotional state nor life satisfaction can be reduced to pleasure
4. Therefore, hedonism is not the correct view of happiness

**Haybron's Diagnosis:**

Hedonism boils down happiness to a series of conscious experiences, but this is too superficial to capture happiness - happiness goes deeper than hedonism allows for (pleasure is just the tip of the iceberg).
