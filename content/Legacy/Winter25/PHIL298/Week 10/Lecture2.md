# Meaning of Life

### Projects of Worth

**Definition:**

Projects of worth are objectively valuable.

**Two Clarifications:**

1. Project is misleading--less defining relationships and involvements central to meaning.
2. There may be no reliable method to rank the worth of individual project.

**Wolf's Account:**

S's life is meaningfull if and only if S is actively engaged in projects of worth.

- General fits with common intuitions about lives that are more/less meaningful
- Makes sense of our needs and longing for meaning

**The Objective Objection:**

Worthwhile pursuits seem meaningful even without active engagement.

- E.g. even if MLK felt disconnected or alienated from his activism, he would have still lived a meaninigful life

**The Objective Account:**

S's life is meaningful if and only if S is devoted to worthwhilel projects and pursuits.

- Accomodates the possibility of meaningful but unhappy lives.
