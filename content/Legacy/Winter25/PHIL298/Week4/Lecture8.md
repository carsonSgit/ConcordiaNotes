# Wellbeing Part 1: Objectivist Theories

## Introduction

*Wellbeing* concerns how well your life is going for you

Prudential Value: The value of things that contribute to or constitute wellbeing
    - Happiness is an important ingredient of wellbeing but there's more to wellbeing than happiness

### Example case: Reclusive Rex

**The Case:**
Rex is an extreme introvert. He does not care about having friends, and does not miss having any. He much prefers his own company. When his family forces him to spend time with people who like him, he doesn't ever learn to enjoy it.

## Two Aspects of Wellbeing

**Subject Relativity:**

There is a special connection between wellbeing and the individual person whose wellbeing it is - what is good for a person must be something that benefits him *as he is*.

**Normative Significance:**

Wellbeing is *good* and what is good doesn't seem to beholden to a variable individual preference and interest.

## Objective Theories

**Objective Theories:**

Whether or not something is good for you does NOT depend on your attitude towards it - things that are good for you are good for you *objectively*.

**Objective List THeories:**

Wellbeing is a matter of checking off items on a list of things that constitute a good human life
- Exampels: friendship, meaningful work, knowledge, health, happiness, achievement, etc.

## Eudaemonist Theories

**Eudaemonist Theories:**

Propose a list of items that constitute wellbeing and an explanation of why these items are objectively good.

**Nussbaum's Eudaemonist Theory:**

S is doing well to the extent that S has the capacity to fulfill the following universal core human functions: **Life /  Bodily Health / Bodily integrity / Thinking / Emotions / Affiliation / Play / Other species / control**

## Evaluating Objective Theories

**The Appeal:**

Can easily accomodate the normative significance aspect of wellbeing.

**The Alienation Problem:**

Seems to imply that what is good for you is alienated from who you are.

- Possible response: There is room for individual personalities because there are various ways that objective goods can be obtained/satisfied
