# Lecture 2: Foundation Knowledge on Human Physiology & Health Terminology


### Body Regulatory Systems

- The Brain (Emotional Regulation)
- Nervous System (Stress Response)
- Enteric Nervous System (the 2nd brain, Gut Health)
- Microbiota Gut-Brain Axis (Gut connection to brain)
- Immune System (Autoimmune Disease)

### Limbic System & Emotional Regulation

- Amygdala
- Prefrontal Cortex

Modern day stressors make the Limbic System increase in activity, causing the  system to become more dominant.


**Prefrontal Cortex:**

- Higher level thinking
- Takes time to develop
- Keeps us stable, calm

**Stress Response and the Amygdala Hijack:**

- When in stress mode, it is hard to relax
- Amygdala takes over in response to stress, hard to come down from it

You can improve this response and "switch" system through Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, etc.


### Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

**Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** HPA AXIS

- *When our body senses danger*
- Fight or Flight
- Gas pedal for nervous system
- Body ready for threat or activity.
  - Alert, excited, ready for action
- Shifts blood away from digestive tract
  - Higher heart rate,
  - Respiration,
  - Pupils dilate,
  - etc.
  

**Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS):** Vagal Nerves

- *When our body senses we are safe*
- Rest and Digest
- Brake pedal for nervous system
- Helps us rest & relax
  - Regenerate after stress or threat
- Aids in digestion

### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axi (HPA Axis)

- Hypothalamus
- Pituitary gland
  - Creates ACTH, ACTH goes to Adrenal glands
- Adrenal glands
  - Cortisol
  - Epinephrine
  - Norepinephrine

HPA Axis = "thermostat" for the body's stress response.

Creates the "Fight or Flight" response which was crucial for primitive survival (**Amygdala**)

Controllable through: breathing, thoughts, lifestyle, etc.

If remain in this HPA AXis for an extended period of time, it increases our stress, cortisol, and disease risk. Leads to the disruption of your metabolic, cognitive/emotional, cardiovascular, and immune function systems.

Stress can cause: Type-2 Diabetes, Anxiety, Depression, Nerve problems, Heart disease, Sex Drive, etc.

### The Enteric Nervous System

- Considered a "second brain"
- 400-600 million nerve endings in the gut
- Why does stress often appear through the digestive system? The issues in your gut effect your whole body and vice versa (mental problems can mess with your digestive system!)
- Stress-related Gut-issues (GI) is known as Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder
  - Quite common

**The Microbiota Gut-Brain Axis** 

- Brain & Gut have a bi-directional Gut-Brain COmmunication
  - Brain -> Gut = ANS, ENS, HPA (Vagus Nerves)
  - Circulation through: Immune, Endocrine (hormone), and Neural Pathways to the brain
- Gut:
  - Gut bacteria
  - Nervous System
  - Immune system
- Brain:
  - Cognition
  - Mood
  - Behaviour

### Communicable vs. Non-Communicable (Chronic) Disease

- Communicable (in this case, E. Coli) is able to be transfered from person to person
  - Spread through air, fluids, surfaces, touch, or vectors (insects)
  - Typically contagious, can cause long-term chronic health issues
  - STI's, Lyme disease, cold and flu, chicken pox, etc.
- Non-communicable (in this case, Alzheimers), not able to be spread
  - Condition that lasts for more than 1 year (can be for life)
  - Requires medical care
  - Impacts Quality of Life
  - Multi-factorial (genetics, lifestyle, environment, age, gender)
  - Cancer, Type-2 Diabetes, etc.

**Cardiometabolic Health:**

- Health indicators of Cardiometabolic disease
  - Blood pressure
  - Blood lipid levels (LDL, HDL, triglycerides)
  - Blood glucose and insulin response
  - Body fat distribution
  - Kidney and liver enzymes

**Metabolic syndrome:**

If you have at least 3 of:

- Low HDL Cholestetrol
- High triglycerides
- Abdomincal obesity
- Elevated fasting glucose
- Hypertension

Means there is a significant risk of other health complications.

**Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes:**

- Type 1
  - *Body doesn't make enough insulin*
  - 5% of all diagnosed diabetes
  - Most common for those under 40 years old
  - **MUST** take insulin
- Type 2
  - *Body doesn't use insulin properly*
  - 95% of all diagnosed diabetes
  - Most common for those over 40 years old
  - **MAY** take insulin, and also look into: diet, exercise, and oral medicines

**Dementia vs. Alzheimer's**

- Dementia
  - General term for symptoms like a decline in:
    - Memory
    - Reasoning
    - Other thinking skills
- Alzheimer's
  - Specific Brain disease that accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases
- Alzheimer's is a Type of Dementia, and a Cause of Dementia

**More also important terms:**

- Healthspan vs. Lifespan
  - Healthspan => The years we live that we are healthy and free from disease
  - Lifespan => Total number of years we live
  - Source: https://www.uvmhealth.org/coronavirus/staying-healthy/life-span-vs-health-span#:~:text=Lifespan%20is%20the%20total%20number,healthy%20and%20free%20from%20disease.
- Morbidity
  - Having a disease/symptom of a disease, or the amount of disease within population
  - Also refers to medical problems caused by treatment
  - Source: https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/morbidity
- Co-Morbidity
  - Simulatenous presence of 2+ diseases/medical conditions in a patient
  - Source: Oxford Languages
- Mortality
  - State of being mortal (destined for death)
  - Also used in reference to death rate, number of deaths in certain group/period of time
  - Source: https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/mortality
- Muscle Hypertrophy
  - Process of increasing the size and strength of a muscle (typically done through weight lifting)
  - Source: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/muscle-hypertrophy#summary
- Muscle Atrophy
  - Loss or thinning of muscle tissue, results in a decrease in mass and strength
  - Source: https://ufhealth.org/conditions-and-treatments/muscle-atrophy#:~:text=Definition,or%20loss%20of%20muscle%20tissue.
- Idiopathic
  - "Relating to or denoting any disease or condition which arises spontaneously or for which the cause is unknown"
  - ^ Used to denote when a health complication occurs without a clear cause.
  - Source: Oxford Languages
- Epigenetic
  - In biology, refers to the changes (typically heritable) in the characteristics of a given cell/organism that of which is a result of a gene alteration/other effects taht do not involve a change to the DNA sequence
  - i.e., "Epigenetics is the study of how cells control gene activity without changing the DNA sequence"
  - Source: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/howgeneswork/epigenome/
- Neurodegeneration
- Oxidative damage
- Low grade cellular inflammation / systemic inflammation
- Metabolic dysfunction
- Carcinogenic
