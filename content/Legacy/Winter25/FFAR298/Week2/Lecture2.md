# Defining the Anthropocene: Theories and Contexts

Anthropocene Working Group: Interdisciplinary research group aiming to understand the anthropocene from a geological sense.

Paul Crutzen popularized the idea of the Anthropocene being the current era of time.

Thomas S. Kuhn popularized the idea of the "paradigm shift": Designates a revolutionary change in the foundational premises of a branch of science that completely transforms the field and its practice. Changing the way we interpret things in our surroundings.

Question: How does Jill Bennett relate Kuhn's notion of a "paradigm shift" to the role of art and cultural production in the Anthropocene ?

Answer: We use art to convey a message in relation to the current Anthropocene, to critique and speak to what is present in modern times. Speaking to the fact that work is continuous and must continue in order to cause change. We are one with the Anthropocene, we are the actors responsible for any change and action.

**Paradigm shift works towards an "eco-action" expression in art.**
    - Art to cause change, under the scope of the course, ecological change

Anthropocene can be viewed as a lens to look at contemeporary society through an ecological and environmental lens in relation to humanity's impact since the great shift in our damaging impact (with the introduction of the steam engine for example).

Biosphere: Life encapsulated in environment, all that is within the "sphere" of nature in relation to life. -> Coined by Vladimir I. Vernadsky, who popularized the term

Capitalocene: Stratigraphic view centered around the impacts of Capitalism and it's effects on ecology

Haraway speaks of Making Kin, the idea to be interconnected in an interspecies sense in the Chthulucene so that we may understand the effects and impact that we hold as humans unto our surroundings.
    - Creating a refuge for all collective organisms to ensure healthy continuation into our future

"Make Kin Not Babies" - Haraway -> Take away from the emphasis put onto reproduction, decentralizing the humanistic ideal of growing mankind's presence in hopes of connecting "kin"

*Ask prof about the idea of "Make Kin Not Babies" being more in regards to the idea of some sort of decentralization of the idea that "Man" is the centerpiece and main focus in a global context, more leaning towards a interconnected view where we put value on all life as one communitive "thing"*

*Ask prof if I could send him a mini project proposal before the term proposal to see if it's an idea that would be fitting as an adequate submission*
