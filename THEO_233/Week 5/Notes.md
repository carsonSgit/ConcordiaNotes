###  People's Century: 1979 God Fights Back Documentary

Various countries in Europe aimed to secularize/modernize society towards the more Western/American standards (suits, style, language, etc.).

Iran fought against this motion to secularize and modernize, protesting and pushing back against a political leader who brought a push of modernization.

Celebrated in the streets with the return of a previously exiled leader who promised to bring back Sharia Law and the strong prevalence of religion in society.

Sudan followed suit through inspiration, banning alcohol and enforcing Religious influence in law. As an example, a construction worker was tried for stealing 4 planks of wood from his job, he was tried without judicial representation and had his hand cut off for theft.

Egypt also had pushback against the movement for modernization, with some religious loyalists seeing disdain within the growth of an Americanized society.

Secularization comes from Western Christianity.
