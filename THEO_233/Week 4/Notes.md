# THEO 233

## Date: September 26, 2024

**J Casanova, Secular, Secularizations**

- The secular is a byproduct of a general decrease in religion rather than a movement to stop religion
- Religion still has prevalence

**The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, August 24/25, 1572**

**Year 1517** - Martin Luther posts to the door his *95 Thesis*  opposing the *Indulgences* offered by the church
> Opposing the idea of *buying salvation*

The Roman Pope was upset by such news, in *1520* he condemned Martin Luther and asked the political authorities for Luther's execution.

Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German making it more accessible.

**The creation of the Anglican Church** was thanks to the Pope disallowing a divorce.

Many reformers opposing the Catholic Church were called the *Protestants*.

#### Social Sciences being challenged

*The Peace of Westphalia (1648)* is referred to as the beginning of secularization and that it brought end to the wars of religion.

Some social scientists are increasingly challenging this idea that Westphalia brought end to religious wars.
They claim that wars were not necessarily of religion, they had varying reasons. 

Their idea suggests that blaming the violences on religion disregards any real analysis of those conflicts.

"the attacks of September 11, 2001 reveal that all mainstream theories of world politics are relentlessly secular with respect to motivation. They ignore the impact of religion, despite the fact that world shaking political movements have so often been fueled by religious fervor" - **Robert Keohane**

#### Separation of religion from politics

Some critics of the idea presented above say that the separation of religion and politics (secularism) should not be globalized.

Secularity is defined negatively as what is left after religion fades -- it is not neutral.

**United States of America Supreme Court** took the First Ammendment and applied it in a particular way -- favoured non-religion. This has since changed though since mid 90s/early 2000s.

#### Distinction of religion from politics

Secular*ism* is the ideology promoting secularity.

Secularism is the ruling of society under the assumption that society is secular. i.e. No pubic figure may wear religious symbols.

##### Secularism and religion

Rise of politically active religious movements complicates our ideas about modern life especially when assuming the world's **secular** character.


#### Secularism and religion

**Religion was not a widely used term**, even by Christians. That is, until the Enlightenment's deployment of the secular/religious distinction.

Before the Enlightenment it was moreso referred to as "faith" and "tradition".

- Today, being secular means:
    - Public insititutions should be entirely free from any religious relation
    - A framework of nonreligious ideas that is explicitly contrasted with religion

*While assuming that religion has somehow declined and withdrawn from the public sphere, it is wrong to assume that the rest has remained intact*.

What Charles Taylor says is that this is a "substraction story". i.e. Quebec schools were once religious, now they are language based. This is not secularization, it is a change.

#### The differentiation of religion from politics

The fight against the religious conformity agreed at Westphalia is what led to the European path to secularism.

Thanks to Westphalia, each state is sovereign without reference to any doctrine such as divine right.

#### Reading discussion

Modernization was often done with the exclusion of religion --> this is what is then claimed by secularism.
